      </div>

      <p>Presenting data in the form of a chart or graph makes identifying patterns and understanding difficult concepts easier. Visualizations of data can bring out insights to someone looking at the data for the first time, as well as convey findings to others who won’t see, or take the time to parse, the raw data.</p>

      <p>Deciding on which chart is best for your data will depend on multiple factors, such as:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>What are the types of metrics, features, or other variables that you plan on plotting? </p></li>
        <li><p>Who is the audience that you plan on presenting to – is it just an initial exploration for yourself, or are you presenting to a broader audience?</p></li>
        <li><p>What is the kind of conclusion that you want the reader to draw?</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>In this article, we’ll look at frequently used charts and graphs to help you make the best choice for presenting your data.</p>

      <h2>Alluvial diagram</h2>
      <img src="imgs/Asylum_seekers.png" loading="lazy">
      <figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2015/05/12/seeking-safety">The Economist</a></figcaption>
      <p>The alluvial diagram is useful for showing changes over time across categories. Each group of stacked bars represents a variable while the size of each segment represents how many observations in the dataset belong to that segment. The colored flows between the bars represent a group of observations between each variable of the flow. The thickness of the flow indicates how many observations belong to that group. In the example above, countries are represented by each bar and the flow tracks refugees as they change countries. Alluvial diagrams are named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluvial_fan">alluvial fans</a>.</p>
      
      <h2>Area chart</h2>
      <h3>Apple Inc. (<small>AAPL</small>) Closing Stock Price</h3>
      <figure id="apple_area"></figure>
      <figcaption>Data: <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-area">Apple stock price</a></figcaption>
      <p>An area graph is a specialized form of the line graph, where data points are connected with a continuous line. The X axis usually represents time or an ordered variable, and the Y axis gives the value of another variable. </p>
      <h3>World electricity production, by source</h3>
      <figure id="electricity"></figure>
      <figcaption class="alignLeft">Data: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/electricity-mix">Our World in Data</a></figcaption>
      <p>A stacked area chart stacks values so that the cumulative area represents 100%. These charts can help to show a progression and composition over time, and the 100% stacked area chart is meant to show the percentage that each component contributes when the cumulative total is not important.</p>
      <h2>Barplot</h2>
      <h3>English letter frequency</h3>
      <figure id="freq_letters"></figure>
      <figcaption>Data: <a href="http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2003-2004/cryptography/subs/frequencies.html">Cornell</a></figcaption>
      <p>A barplot (or barchart) is one of the most common types of graphic. It shows the relationship between a numeric and a categoric variable. Each value of the categoric variable is represented as a bar. The size of the bar represents its numeric value. The baseline starts at zero.</p>
      <h3>Global Emissions by Country</h3>
      <figure id="country_emissions"></figure>
      <figcaption>Data: <a href="https://www.iea.org/articles/global-energy-review-co2-emissions-in-2020">IEA</a></figcaption>
      <p>A variation on the regular vertical bar chart is the horizontal bar chart. This orientation is more useful for comparing categories.</p>
      <h2>Barcode chart</h2>
      <h3>Surface temperature anomalies</h3>
      <figcaption id="anomaly_legend"></figcaption>
      <figure id="anomaly_barcode"></figure>
      <figcaption>Data: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/hadcrut-surface-temperature-anomaly?tab=table">Our World in Data</a></figcaption>
      <p>A compact way to show a distribution. In a barcode chart, line segments represent individual data points along a single axis.</p>
      <h2>Baseline chart</h2>
      <h3>Stock Price Comparison</h3>
      <figure id="stocks_baseline"></figure>
      <figcaption>Market Data: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data">Wall Street Journal</a></figcaption>
      <p>A baseline chart uses a reference point, which becomes the baseline, to compare all the other categories to. In business, the success of a project or product is often measured against a <strong>baseline</strong> number for costs, sales, or other variables. A project may exceed a baseline number or fail to meet it.</p>
      <h2>Beeswarm </h2>
      <!-- <figure id="beeswarm"></figure> -->
      <img src="https://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hospital-billing-1536x1127.png" loading="lazy">
      <p>Beeswarm plots are a fun, visually pleasing alternative to histograms that can be used when data is sufficiently small and you want to plot every point. A beeswarm chart is a one-dimensional chart that shows all the information on a single-axis (usually the X axis). It is similar to a strip plot, except that would-be overlapping points are separated such that each is visible. </p>
      <h2>Box plot</h2>
      <h3>Michaelson-Morley Speed of Light Data</h3>
      <figure id="morley"></figure>
      <figcaption>Data: <a href="http://stats4stem.weebly.com/r-morley-data.html">Morley dataset</a></figcaption>
      <p>Box plots, also called box-and-whisker plots or box-whisker plots, give a good graphical image of the concentration of the data. A box plot is constructed from five values: the minimum value, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the maximum value. We use these values to compare how close other data values are to them.</p>
      <h2>Bubble chart</h2>
      <h3>Health and Wealth of Nations, 2007</h3>
      <figure id="gapminder"></figure>
      <figcaption>Data: <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/data/">GapMinder Foundation</a></figcaption>
      <p>A bubble chart is a variation of a scatter chart in which the data points are replaced with bubbles, and an additional dimension of the data is represented in the size of the bubbles. Just like a scatter chart, a bubble chart does not use a category axis — both horizontal and vertical axes are value axes. In addition to the x values and y values that are plotted in a scatter chart, a bubble chart also z (size) values.</p>
      <h2>Bullet chart</h2>
      <h3>Proportion of COVID-19 cases vs. share of population, by race</h3>
      <figure id="bullet"></figure>
      <figcaption>Data: <a href="https://covidtracking.com/race">The COVID Racial Data Tracker</a></figcaption>
      <p>A Bullet Graph is a variation of a Bar Graph. The main data value is encoded by a length of the main bar in the middle of the chart, known as the <b>Feature Measure</b>. The line marker that runs perpendicular to the orientation of the graph is known as the <b>Comparative Measure</b> and is used as a target marker to compare against the Feature Measure value. So if the main bar has passed the position of Comparative Measure, you know you’ve hit your goal.</p>
      <h2>Bump chart</h2>
      <h3>Changes in state population, 1920 - 2020</h3>
      <img src="https://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/population-shift-1536x1084.png" loading="lazy">
      <figcaption>Image: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2021/census-population-changes/">Washington Post</a></figcaption>
      <p>A bump chart is a chart that helps you identify the change in the performance rankings over time rather than the magnitude of the values of the elements (categories).</p>
      <h2>Cartogram</h2>
      <h3>Who can vote by mail?</h3>
      <img src="https://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Cartogram-to-show-vote-by-mail-1536x1235.png" loading="lazy">
      <figcaption>Image: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/11/us/politics/vote-by-mail-us-states.html">New York Times</a></figcaption>
      <p>Cartograms distort the shape of geographic regions so that the area directly encodes a data variable. A common example is to redraw every country in the world sizing it proportionally to population or GDP. Can be done by circles, squares or distorted maps by manipulating the initial map.</p>
      <h2>Candlestick Chart</h2>
      <h3>Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Price</h3>
      <figure id="candlestick"></figure>
      <figcaption>Data: <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-area">Apple stock price</a></figcaption>
      <p>A candlestick chart is a style of bar chart used to describe price movements of a security, derivative, or currency for a designated span of time. Each bar represents the range of price movement over a given time interval. The dataset for a candlestick chart contains low, high, open and close values. The high and low values are visualized as the top and bottom of each stick, where the open and close values are reflected in the square inside.</p>
      <h2>Chord diagram</h2>
      <a href="https://lotr.visualcinnamon.com/"><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa9d88da1855554db37b1e1/5fb1377b21d82ea1d953ef91_lotr_final.png" loading="lazy"></a>
      <figcaption>Created by <a href="https://lotr.visualcinnamon.com">Nadieh Bremer</a></figcaption>
      <p>This type of diagram visualizes the inter-relationships between entities. The connections between entities are used to display that they share something in common. This makes Chord Diagrams ideal for comparing the similarities within a dataset or between different groups of data.</p>
      <h2>Choropleth map</h2>
      <!-- TODO -->
      <img src="imgs/ZIP3_zones.svg" loading="lazy">
      <figcaption>ZIP codes explained <a href="inf-hoe-graphic.html">here</a></figcaption>
      <p>A choropleth map is simply a shaded map. Specifically, it's a map that uses measured differences in shading or color or the placing of symbols inside defined areas on the map in order to indicate the average values of some property or quantity in those areas. Be careful with your color choices, as they can quickly change what the map shows.</p>
      <h2>Connected scatter plot</h2>
      <h3>Driving shifts into reverse</h3>
      <figure id="driving_line"></figure>
      <figcaption class="">Data: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2010/05/02/business/02metrics.html">New York Times</a></figcaption>
      <p>Until recently, Americans have driven more each year than the previous one, with a few brief exceptions. In 1956, Americans of driving age drove about 4,000 miles a year, on average. Fifty years later, that figure had climbed above 10,000. A cross between a scatterplot and a time series, the connected scatter plot  . Show two variables over time.</p>
      <h2>Density plot</h2>
      <h3>Unemployment by industry</h3>
      <figure id="bls_line"></figure>
      <figcaption>Data: <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a></figcaption>
      <p>A density plot visualizes the distribution of data over a continuous interval or time period. This chart is a variation of a histogram that uses kernel smoothing to plot values, allowing for smoother distributions by smoothing out the noise. The peaks of a density plot help display where values are concentrated over the interval.</p>
<!--     <h2>Difference chart</h2>
  <p>A difference chart highlights the difference between two values, typically entries vs exits. The amount is encoded as height, and the sign (surplus vs. deficit) as a solid color.</p> -->
  <h2>Donut chart 🍩</h2>
  <!-- TODO -->
  <h3>United States Population, 2015</h3>
  <img src="imgs/donut_chart.svg" loading="lazy">
  <figcaption>Data: <a href="https://www.census.gov/data.html">U.S. Census</a></figcaption>
  <p>A donut chart is a pie chart with an area of the center cut out. It looks like a donut. That’s why it’s called a donut chart.</p>
  <p>Pie Charts are sometimes criticized for focusing readers on the proportional areas of the slices to one another and to the chart as a whole. This makes it tricky to see the differences between slices, especially when you try to compare multiple Pie Charts together. A Donut Chart somewhat remedies this problem by de-emphasizing the use of the area. Instead, readers focus more on reading the length of the arcs, rather than comparing the proportions between slices.</p>
  <h2>Dot density map</h2>
  <!-- <img src="https://flowingdata.com/wp-content/themes/fd-modern-5-9/images/chart-types/dot-density-map.png" loading="lazy"> -->
  <figure id="dotdensity"></figure>
  <figcaption>Data: <a href="Walmart.html">Walmart stores</a></figcaption>
  <p>The density mark shows the estimated density of two-dimensional point clouds. Contours guide the eye towards the local peaks of concentration of the data, much like a topographic map does with elevation. This is especially useful given overplotting in dense datasets, like the above map of Walmart locations in the USA.</p>
  <h2>Dot map</h2>
  <!-- <img src="https://flowingdata.com/wp-content/themes/fd-modern-5-9/images/chart-types/dot-map.png" loading="lazy"> -->
  <h3>World airports</h3>
  <figure id="dotmap"></figure>
  <figcaption>Data: <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/world-airports">World airports</a></figcaption>
  <p>Dot Maps are a way of detecting spatial patterns or the distribution of data over a geographical region, by placing equally sized points over a geographical region.</p>
  <h2>Dot plot</h2>    
  <h3>Surface temperature anomalies</h3>
  <figcaption id="anomaly_legend1"></figcaption>
  <figure id="anomaly_dot"></figure>
  <figcaption>Data: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/hadcrut-surface-temperature-anomaly?tab=table">Our World in Data</a></figcaption>
  <p>A generalized form of the scatter plot, the dots can be placed in various coordinate systems on an x- and y-axis. A dot plot is similar to a histogram in that it displays the number of data points that fall into each category or value on the axis, thus showing the distribution of a set of data.</p>
  <h2>Frequency trails</h2>
  <h3>Google search trends, 2020</h3>
  <figure id="google_ridgeline"></figure>
  <figcaption>Data: <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US">Google</a></figcaption>
  <!-- <img src="https://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Interactive-frequency-trails.png"> -->

  <h2>Gantt chart</h2>
  <img src="https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/top_images/SVG/gantt_chart.svg" loading="lazy">
  <p>Commonly used as an organizational tool for project management, Gantt Charts display a list of activities (or tasks) with their duration over time, showing when each activity starts and ends. This makes Gantt Charts useful for planning and estimating how long an entire project might take. You can also see what activities are running in parallel to each other.</p>

  <p>Glyph charts are a common form of visual design where a data set is depicted by a collection of visual objects referred to as <em>glyphs</em>. The design of glyphs can make use of many different visual channels such as shape, colour, texture, size, orientation, aspect ratio or curvature<a href="#glyph" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="glyph-ref"></a>. This enables the depiction of multi-dimensional data attributes, such as time series data. Meanwhile, glyphs are normally recognisable individually, offering a means of visual fusion in multi-field visualization. 🤓</p>

  <figcaption></figcaption> <!-- Recreation: https://observablehq.com/@zanarmstrong/us-grid-map-and-observable-plot -->
  <p>Instead of using geographic boundaries, same-size cells are used to represent areas to provide equal visual attention to all.</p>
  <h2>Heatmap</h2>
  <figure id="popcorn"></figure>
  <figcaption>Source: <a href="popcorn.html">Steph Curry, NYT</a></figcaption>
  <p>Heatmaps visualize data through variations in coloring. When used in a tabular format, heatmaps are useful for cross-examining multivariate data, through placing variables in the rows and columns and coloring the cells within the table. Heatmaps are good for showing variance across multiple variables, revealing any patterns, displaying whether any variables are similar to each other, and for detecting if any correlations exist in-between them.</p>
  <h2>Histogram</h2>
  <h3>Apple Inc. (AAPL) Trading Volume</h3>
  <figure id="example_histogram"></figure>
  <figcaption class="alignLeft">Data: <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-area">Apple stock price</a></figcaption>
  <p>A histogram looks like a bar chart, but it reads differently. The baseline is continuous instead of discrete categories, which allows one to see distributions. Histograms help give an estimate as to where values are concentrated, what the extremes are and whether there are any gaps or unusual values. They are also useful for giving a rough view of the probability distribution.</p>
  <h2>Horizon graph</h2>
  <img src="https://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/cost-horizon-reversed.png" loading="lazy">
  <p>A horizon chart is like a combination area chart and heatmap. Shrink the area chart by slicing it horizontally, and then shift the slices to a baseline of zero.</p>
  <h2>Line chart</h2>
  <h3>My excitement levels as my girlfriend says...</h3>
  <figure id="example_line"></figure>
  <p>Typically used to show trends over time, the slope of the line between two points shows patterns of change. Line Graphs are drawn by first plotting data points on a Cartesian coordinate grid, then connecting a line between all of these points. Typically, the y-axis has a quantitative value, while the x-axis is a timescale or a sequence of intervals. Negative values can be displayed below the x-axis.</p>

  <p>The direction of the lines on the graph works as a nice metaphor for the data: an upward slope indicates where values have increased and a downward slope indicates where values have decreased. The line's journey across the graph can create patterns that reveal trends in a dataset.

  When grouped with other lines (other data series), individual lines can be compared to one another. However, avoid using more than 3-4 lines per graph, as this makes the chart more cluttered and harder to read. A solution to this is to divide the chart into smaller multiples (have a small Line Graph for each data series).</p>
  <h2>Mosaic plot</h2>
  <figure id="mosaic"></figure>
  <figcaption>Data: <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-marimekko">Fictional sales</a></figcaption>
  <p>Also known as a Marimekko diagram, this chart uses the width and height of rectangles to represent separate variables. It can be useful to represent multidimensional data. The main flaws of Marimekko charts are that they can be hard to read, especially when there are many segments. Also, it's hard to accurately make comparisons between each segment, as they are not all arranged next to each other along a common baseline. Therefore, Marimekko charts are better suited for giving a more general overview of the data.

  <figure id="network"></figure>
  <figcaption>Data: <a href="http://mercury.lcs.mit.edu/~jnc/tech/arpageo.html">MIT</a></figcaption>
  <p>This type of visualization shows how things are interconnected through the use of nodes and link lines. Typically, nodes are drawn as dots or circles, but icons can also be used. Links are usually displayed as lines connecting nodes. However, in more elaborate network diagrams, not all of the nodes and links are created equally: additional variables can be shown by making the node size or link stroke weight proportional to an assigned value.

  <h2>Organogram</h2>
  <img src="https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/top_images/tree_diagram.png" loading="lazy">
  <p>An organogram is an organizational chart that shows the structure of an organization and the relationships and relative ranks of its parts and positions/jobs. A variation is a tree diagram, which shows the different elements of a field of knowledge or a group of languages.</p>
  <h2>Packed bubble chart</h2>

  <figcaption>Data: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/05/health/covid-vaccine-first.html">New York Times</a></figcaption>
  <p>Circle size represents data like with a bubble chart, but there is typically no x-y axis. Instead, bubble position often represents grouping or is used to maximize space.</p>
  <h2>Parallel coordinates</h2>
  <h3>Cars from the 70s & 80s</h3>
  <img src="https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/top_images/SVG/parallel_coordinates.svg" loading="lazy">
  <p>Parallel Coordinates Plots are ideal for comparing many variables together and seeing the relationships between them. In the above example, models of cars produced in the 1970s and '80s are compared across multiple variables. Chris Evans created a <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~cme2126/datavisuals/bigdata_parallelcoordinates.html">more elaborate example</a> using the same data set.</p>
  <p>In a parallel coordinates plot, each variable is given its own axis and all the axes are placed in parallel to each other. Each axis can have a different scale, as each variable works off a different unit of measurement, or all the axes can be normalized to keep all the scales uniform. Values are plotted as a series of lines that connected across all the axes. This means that each line is a collection of points placed on each axis, that have all been connected together.</p>
  <h2>Parallel sets</h2>
  <img src="https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/top_images/parallel_sets.png" loading="lazy">
  <p>Parallel Set charts are similar to Sankey Diagrams in the way they show flow and proportions. However, Parallel Sets don’t use arrows and they divide the flow-path at each displayed line-set. Each line-set corresponds to a dimension/dataset, which its values/categories are represented in each line divide in that line-set. The width of each line and the flow-path that stems from it is determined by the proportional fraction of the category total. Each flow-path can be colored to show and compare the distribution between different categories.</p>
  <h2>Percentogram</h2>

  <p>The “<a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/04/13/the-percentogram-a-histogram-binned-by-percentages-of-the-cumulative-distribution-rather-than-using-fixed-bin-widths/">percentogram</a>” is a histogram binned by percentages of the cumulative distribution, rather than using fixed bin widths. Put simply, it is like a histogram or density plot in that is shows the overall shape of the distribution, where each bar is made to have the same area and to specifically represent a chosen percentage. A percentogram makes it easy to assess how much of a distribution is falling in particular ranges.</p>
  <h2>Pictogram</h2>
  <h3>Phish set list, NYE 2019</h3>
  <img src="imgs/phish.svg" loading="lazy">
  <figcaption>Data: <a href="https://observablehq.com/@mayagans/day-2-pictograms">Maya Gans</a></figcaption>
  <p>Pictogram Charts use icons to give a more engaging overall view of small sets of discrete data. Typically, the icons represent the data’s subject or category, for example, data on population would use icons of people. Each icon can represent one unit or any number of units (e.g. each icon represents 10). Data sets are compared side-by-side in either columns or rows of icons, to compare each category to one another.</p>
  <h2>Pie chart</h2>
  <h3>United States population, 2015</h3>
  <img src="imgs/pie_chart.svg" loading="lazy">
  <figcaption>Data: <a href="https://www.census.gov/data.html">U.S. Census</a></figcaption>
  <p>Pie Charts help show proportions and percentages between categories, by dividing a circle into proportional segments. Each arc length represents a proportion of each category, while the full circle represents the total sum of all the data, equal to 100%.</p>
  <h2>Proportion Plot</h2>
  <figure id="proportion_plot"></figure>
  <figcaption>Data: <a href="https://stephanieevergreen.com/proportion-plots/">Stephanie Evergreen</a></figcaption>
  <p>Pioneered by Stephanie Evergreen, proportion plots are useful to highlight differences between the share of a population across two metrics. Here we follow Richard Speigal’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6758306750174138368/">“Who owns Britain?</a>” chart, highlighting age class inequalities in Britain.

  <p>A Population Pyramid chart is a pair of back-to-back Histograms (for each sex) that displays the distribution of a population in all age groups and in both sexes. The X-axis is used to plot population numbers and the Y-axis lists all age groups.</p>
  <h2>Radar chart</h2>
  <img src="https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/top_images/radar_chart.png" loading="lazy">
  <p>Radar charts, also known as as spider chart, web chart, polar chart, or star plots, are a way of comparing multiple quantitative variables. This makes them useful for seeing which variables have similar values or if there are any outliers among each variable. Radar Charts are also useful for seeing which variables are scoring high or low within a dataset, making them ideal for displaying performance.</p>
  <h2>Sankey diagram</h2>

  <p>Sankey Diagrams display flows and their quantities in proportion to one another. Typically used to show the transfer of energy, money or materials, but they can be used to show the flow of any isolated process in a system. The width of the arrows or lines are used to show their magnitudes, so the bigger the arrow, the larger the quantity of flow. Flow arrows or lines can combine together or split through their paths on each stage of a process. Colour can be used to divide the diagram into different categories or to show the transition from one state of the process to another.</p>
  <h2>Scatter plot</h2>    
  <h3>The relative harm of drugs</h3>
  <figure id="drug_scatter"></figure>
  <figcaption class="alignLeft">Data: David Nutt for <a href="https://www.drugscience.org.uk">Drug Science</a></figcaption>
  <p>Also known as a scatter graph, point graph, X-Y plot, scatter chart or scattergram. Scatterplots use a collection of points placed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system">Cartesian Coordinates</a> to display values from two variables. By displaying a variable on each axis, you can detect if a relationship or correlation between the two variables exists.</p>

  <figcaption>Data: <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/seds/">State Energy Data System (SEDS), US Energy Information Administration</a></figcaption>
  <p>Also known as a <i>slopegraph</i>, this type of chart shows change in rank between two (or a few) discrete points in time. Typically used to compare changes over time for a list of nouns (e.g. countries) located on an ordinal or interval scale (e.g. GDP).

  <!-- <img src="https://nuitrcs.github.io/intro_to_viz_workshop/files/2context.png"> -->
  <p>Small multiples use the same basic graphic or chart to display different slices of a data set. Small multiples can show rich, multi-dimensional data without trying to cram all that information into a single, overly-complex chart. Small multiples go by many names, including Trellis Chart, Lattice Chart, Grid Chart, and Panel Chart. I would even argue that sparklines are a simpler, smaller cousin of small multiples.</p>
  <h2>Spiral chart</h2>
  <img src="https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/top_images/PNG/spiral_plot.png" loading="lazy">
  <p>This type of visualisation plots time-based data along an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_spiral">Archimedean spiral</a>. The graph begins at the centre of a spiral and then progresses outwards. Spiral Plots are versatile and can use bars, lines or points to be displayed along the spiral path.</p>
  <h2>Square pie chart</h2>
  <figure id="waffle"></figure>
  <p>Square charts, also called waffle charts, are a form of pie charts that use squares instead of circles to represent percentages. Similar to basic circular pie charts, square pie charts take each percentage out of a total 100%. They are often 10 by 10 grids, where each cell represents 1%. Despite the name, circles, pictograms (such as of people), and other shapes may be used instead of squares. One major benefit to square charts is that smaller percentages, difficult to see on traditional pie charts, can be easily depicted.</p>

  <figcaption>Data: <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a></figcaption>
  <p>Stacked area graphs work in the same way as regular area graphs, except for the use of multiple data series that start each point from the point left by the previous data series. The entire graph represents the total of all the data plotted. Stacked Area Graphs also use the areas to convey whole numbers, so they do not work for negative values. Overall, they are useful for comparing multiple variables changing over an interval.</p>

<h3>Caltrain’s Palo Alto station schedule</h3>
<figure id="stem_plot"></figure>
<figcaption>Data: <a href="https://www.caltrain.com/stations/paloaltostation.html">Caltrain</a></figcaption>
<p>A Stem and Leaf Plot is a special table where each data value is split into a "stem" (the first digit or digits) and a "leaf" (usually the last digit). The "stem" values are listed down, and the "leaf" values go right (or left) from the stem values. The "stem" is used to group the scores and each "leaf" shows the individual scores within each group.</p>
<p>In the example above, the stem is the hour of the day and the leaf is the minute of when a Caltrain running Southbound (left) or Northbound (right) is scheduled to arrive. The color of each leaf encodes the type of train arriving.</p>

<p>Stream Graphs display the changes in data over time of different categories through the use of flowing, organic shapes that somewhat resemble a river-like stream. This makes Stream Graphs aesthetically pleasing and more engaging to look at. In a Stream Graph, the size of each individual stream shape is proportional to the values in each category.</p>

<p>Ben Shneiderman originally developed Treemaps as a way of visualising a vast file directory on a computer, without taking up too much space on the screen. This makes Treemaps a more compact and space-efficient option for displaying hierarchies, that gives a quick overview of the structure. Treemaps are also great at comparing the proportions between categories via their area size.</p>
