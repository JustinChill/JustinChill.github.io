## What is
# An API?

API stands for Application Programming Interface, and it is a way for software services to exchange information, usually over the internet. An API is a set up instructions that computers use to query (request) information from each other, like requesting a database. Specifically, an API defines a standard format for data to be exchanged. 

## Common Terminology

 * ### Endpoint
 Endpoints mean the different kinds of urls in your api ends with. They are associated with the GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods of your APIs.

 * ### REST
 It stands for Representational State Transfer. The modern standard for making APIs. Most people confuse this as a technology, but actually this is more of a concept, a standard set of best practices to make APIs.
 * ### URL Encoded
 Sometimes you need to pass some things in your API query params which could create some issues like spaces, forward slashes etc. You need to encode these special characters so that they can be sent over the internet. You can find a reference of these characters on w3schools.
