    <p>We're no strangers to love
      You know the rules and so do I
      A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
      You wouldn't get this from any other guy
      I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
      Gotta make you understand
      Never gonna give you up
      Never gonna let you down
      Never gonna run around and desert you
      Never gonna make you cry
      Never gonna say goodbye
      Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
      We've known each other for so long
      Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
      Inside we both know what's been going on
      We know the game and we're gonna play it
      And if you ask me how I'm feeling
      Don't tell me you're too blind to see
      Never gonna give you up
      Never gonna let you down
      Never gonna run around and desert you
      Never gonna make you cry
      Never gonna say goodbye
      Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
      Never gonna give you up
