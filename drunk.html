      <p>Drunk elegantly cuts through the tangle of urban legends and anecdotal impressions that surround our notions of
        intoxication to provide a rigorous, scientifically-grounded explanation for our love of alcohol. Drawing on
        evidence from archaeology, history, cognitive neuroscience, psychopharmacology, social psychology, literature,
        and genetics, Edward Slingerland shows that our taste for chemical intoxicants is not an evolutionary mistake,
        as we are so often told.</p>
      <p>In fact, intoxication helps solve a number of distinctively human challenges: enhancing creativity, alleviating
        stress, building trust, and pulling off the miracle of getting fiercely tribal primates to cooperate with
        strangers. Our desire to get drunk, along with the individual and social benefits provided by drunkenness,
        played a crucial role in sparking the rise of the first large-scale societies. We would not have civilization
        without intoxication<a href="#casbs" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="casbs-ref"></a>.</p>
      <q>The ubiquity of drug use is so striking that it must represent a basic human appetite</q>
      <h2>Key takeaways</h2>
      <p><strong>Ancient roots.</strong> The desire to alter one's mental state through intoxication is not a recent
        phenomenon. Archaeological evidence reveals that humans have been using alcohol and other substances for
        millennia, dating back as far as 7000 BCE in China.</p>
      <p>From fermented beverages to hallucinogenic plants, the pursuit of altered states is a constant throughout human
        history. For our ancestors, inebriation was especially essential, “a robust and elegant response to the
        challenges of getting a selfish, suspicious, narrowly goal-oriented primate to loosen up and connect with
        strangers.”</p>
      <p><strong>The cooperation challenge.</strong> Humans are intensely social creatures, relying on cooperation and
        mutual support for survival. The challenge for humans is to reconcile our selfish ape nature with the demands of
        large-scale social cooperation.</p>
      <p>Overcoming this tension requires mechanisms for building trust, enforcing norms, and suppressing individual
        self-interest. Intoxication, as we will see, plays a crucial role in this process.</p>

      <p><strong>A versatile tool.</strong> Alcohol is uniquely suited for temporarily altering brain function. It's
        easy to produce, consume, and dose, and its effects are relatively predictable. Alcohol targets the brain's
        prefrontal cortex, reducing cognitive control and promoting relaxation, creativity, and social bonding.</p>
      <p>“It is no accident that, in the brutal competition of cultural groups from which civilizations emerged, it is
        the drinkers, smokers and trippers who emerged triumphant,” Slingerland writes: Human society would not exist
        without ample lubrication<a href="#NYT" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="NYT-ref"></a>.</p>
      <q class="mid-size">If you tasked a cultural engineering team with designing a substance that would satisfy specs
        aimed at maximizing individual creativity and group cooperation, they would come up with something very much
        like alcohol.</q>
      <h3>Distillation and Isolation.</h3>
      <p><strong>Distillation's impact.</strong> The invention of distillation has created a new level of risk
        associated with alcohol consumption. Distilled spirits are far more potent than naturally fermented beverages,
        making it easier to become dangerously intoxicated.</p>
      <p><strong>The rise of isolation.</strong> Modern lifestyles have led to a decline in traditional social
        structures and an increase in solitary activities. This isolation has made it easier to abuse alcohol, as
        individuals are no longer subject to the same social controls and monitoring.</p>
      <p><strong>A toxic combination.</strong> The combination of distilled spirits and social isolation has created a
        perfect storm for alcohol abuse. Without the constraints of traditional social norms, individuals are more
        likely to develop alcohol dependence and experience its negative consequences<a href="#sb"
