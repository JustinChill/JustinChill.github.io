      <p>In the United States we pay more for healthcare than any other nation. Which got me wondering, what do we get for that? One way to measure it is to look at life expectancy. There is more that goes into life expectancy than just healthcare. For example, lifestyle choices such as smoking rates. Yet when I modeled life expectancy as a function of a nation's healthcare spending, spending alone explains 56% of a countries life expectancy. That was based on data for 2019. However, I get a similar result for just every other year I created a model for - spending explains about half of a countries life expectancy rate.</p>
      <p>As you can see from the visual of 37 OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries, even if we spend an unlimited amount of money, it doesn't mean we'll live forever. At some point we get diminishing returns. </p>
      <p>The optimal spending appears to be around $6300 ppp/per capita. Specifically for this dataset it was $6313.06 ppp/per capita. If you're wondering what PPP is, it stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity">purchasing power parity</a>. This allows us to compare costs across different size economies and then that number is adjusted to calculate the cost per person (per capita). </p>
      <p>In the US we spend more than any other country and only live longer than eight others. One of the reasons appears to be the type of healthcare system we have in the US. We are the only nation without a universal system. However, even without a universal system, in 2019 our government still paid half of healthcare costs.</p>
      <p>Not all universal systems mean government funded healthcare. There are four different kinds of systems that other nations use to guarantee their citizens access to healthcare. I've explained those systems below. Interestingly in the middle of working on this a study based on 2021 data had the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/31/health/us-health-care-spending-global-perspective/index.html">same findings</a>. Honestly, nothing makes me happier than validation that I really do know what I'm talking about.</p>
      <h2>Classifications of Healthcare Systems</h2>
      <h3>Universal Government Funded Healthcare</h3>
      <p>Also known as single-payer healthcare, it is government healthcare funded through income taxes that is available to all citizens regardless of income or employment status.</p>
      <h3>Universal Public/Private Insurance</h3>
      <p>A hybrid system where citizens can receive primary healthcare through the private market, and those who aren't eligible can receive it from the government.</p>
      <h3>Universal Public Insurance</h3>
      <p>Government healthcare funded through payroll taxes, which is divided between employee and employer. People who don't have legal contract of employment and/or can't register as unemployed may be ineligible for free health care.</p>
      <h3>Universal Private Insurance</h3>
      <p>Healthcare is mandated through private insurance, usually subsidized by the government for low-income citizens.</p>
      <h3>Non-Universal Insurance</h3>
      <p>Some citizens have private health insurance, some are eligible for subsidized public health care, while some are not insured at all.</p>
