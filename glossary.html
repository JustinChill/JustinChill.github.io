          <h2>Area Graphs</h2>
          <p><b>Area Graphs</b> are line graphs with the area below the line filled in with a certain color or texture. They are most commonly used to show trends, rather than convey specific values. Area Graphs are drawn by first plotting data points like a line graph, joining a line between the points and finally filling in the space below the completed line.</p>

          <figure id="example_area"></figure>
          <p class="visually-hidden">Two popular variations of Area Graphs are: grouped and Stacked Area Graphs. Grouped Area Graphs start from the same zero axis, while Stacked Area Graphs have each data series start from the point left by the previous data series.</p>

          <h2>Bar graph</h2>
          <p><b>Bar Graph</b> or <b>Column Graph</b>. The classic Bar Chart uses horizontal bars to show discrete, numerical comparisons across categories. One axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared and the other axis represents a discrete value scale (<i>e.g. 1 - 10 </i>). The chart uses <b>categorical</b> data and therefore answers the question of <i>"how many?"</i> in each category. One major flaw with Bar Charts is that labeling becomes problematic when there are a large number of bars.</p>

          <h2>Box and whisker plot</h2>
          <!--  Example from Bostock: https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/plot-box -->
          <p><b>Box and Whisker Plot</b> (or <b>Box Plot</b>) is a convenient way of visually displaying the data distribution through their quartiles. The lines extending parallel from the boxes are known as the “whiskers”, which are used to indicate variability outside the upper and lower quartiles. Outliers are sometimes plotted as individual dots that are in-line with whiskers. Box Plots can be drawn either vertically or horizontally. Although Box Plots may seem primitive in comparison to a Histogram or Density Plot, they have the advantage of taking up less space, which is useful when comparing distributions between many groups or datasets.</p>

          <h2>Bubble chart</h2>
          <p>A <b>Bubble Chart</b> is a Scatterplot mixed with a Proportional Area Chart. Like a Scatterplot, Bubble Charts use a Cartesian (a grid) coordinate system to plot points along a grid where the X and Y axis are separate variables. However. unlike a Scatterplot, each point is assigned a label or category (either displayed alongside or on a legend). Each plotted point then represents a third variable by the area of its circle. For example, Colors can also be used to distinguish between categories or used to represent an additional data variable. Time can be shown either by having it as a variable on one of the axis or by animating the data variables changing over time.</p>

          <p>Bubble Charts are typically used to compare and show the relationships between categorized circles, by the use of positioning and proportions. The overall picture of Bubble Charts can be used to analyze for patterns/correlations.</p>

            <p><b>Bullet Graph</b>s functions like a Bar Chart, but are accompanied by extra visual elements to pack in more context. Originally, Bullet Graphs were developed by Stephen Few as an alternative to dashboard gauges and meters. This is because they often displayed not enough information, were less space-efficient and were cluttered with "chartjunk". The main data value is encoded by the length of the main bar in the middle of the chart, known as the Feature Measure. The line marker that runs perpendicular to the graph is known as the Comparative Measure and is used as a target marker to compare against the Feature Measure value. So if the main bar has passed the position of Comparative Measure, you know you’ve hit your goal. When using Bullet Graphs, it's ideal to keep the maximum number of ranges to five.</p>
            
            <p>The segmented colored bars behind the Feature Measure are used to display qualitative range scores. Each color shade (the three shades of grey in the example above) are used to assign a performance range rating. So for example, poor, average and great.</p>

            <h2>Candlestick chart</h2>
            <p><b>Candlestick Chart</b> (a.k.a. Japanese Candlestick Chart) is used as a trading tool to visualize and analyse the price movements over time for securities, derivatives, currencies, stocks, bonds, commodities, etc. Although the symbols used in Candlestick Charts resemble a Box Plot, they function differently and therefore, are not to be confused with one another. Candlestick Charts display multiple bits of price information such as the open price, close price, highest price and lowest price through the use of candlestick-like symbols. Each symbol represents the compressed trading activity for a single time period (a minute, hour, day, month, etc). Each Candlestick symbol is plotted along a time scale on the x-axis, to show the trading activity over time.</p>

          <li>
            <h2>Cardinality</h2>
            <p>The <b>cardinality</b> of a set means the number of its elements. For example, the set A = {2, 4, 6} contains 3 elements, and therefore A has a cardinality of 3.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Cartesian coordinates</h2>
            <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Cartesian-coordinate-system.svg" height="300px"><b>Cartesian coordinates</b> - all possible combinations of values from two dimensions. For example, the geometric plane consists of points which can be represented by 2 coordinate axes (hence 2-dimensional or Cartesian coordinate system). Imagine a grid- if you can picture battleship, even better- and you're mostly there.</p>

            <p class="visually-hidden">Or we have two dimensions with low cardinality we can use a Cartesian product, to create one dimension. For example, we have data about population gender (male, female, non-binary) and age, using categorization for age (>= 50, < 50) and Cartesian product we can achieve one dimension with 6 values.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Categorization</h2>
            <p><b>Categorization</b> - aggregate data by grouping items. For example, instead of building a graph for all values of <code>age</code> you can create two categories: more than or equal to (≥) 50 years, less than (<) 50 years.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Chord diagrams</h2>
            <p>This type of diagram visualizes the inter-relationships between entities. The connections between entities are used to display that they share something in common. This makes Chord Diagrams ideal for comparing the similarities within a dataset or between different groups of data.</p>
            <a href="https://lotr.visualcinnamon.com/"><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa9d88da1855554db37b1e1/5fb1377b21d82ea1d953ef91_lotr_final.png"></a>
            <p>Nodes are arranged along a circle, with the relationships between points connected to each other either through the use of arcs or Bézier curves. Values are assigned to each connection, which is represented proportionally by the size of each arc. Color can be used to group the data into different categories, which aids in making comparisons and distinguishing groups. <br>Technically, the above chart is an adaptation of a standard chord diagram. However, I think it's to cool not to share. This art was created by <a href="https://www.visualcinnamon.com">Nadieh Bremmer</a> and plots dialogue from the Lord of the Rings by character and place.</p>

            <figcaption>ZIP codes explained <a href="inf-hoe-graphic.html">here</a></figcaption>
            <p><b>Choropleth Maps</b> display divided geographical areas or regions that are colored, shaded or patterned in relation to a data variable. This provides a way to visualize values over a geographical area, which can show variation or patterns across the displayed location. One downside to the use of color is that you can't accurately read or compare values from the map. Another issue is that larger regions appear more emphasized then smaller ones, so the viewer's perception of the shaded values are affected. A common error when producing Choropleth Maps is to encode raw data values (such as population) rather than using normalized values (calculating population per square kilometer for example) to produce a density map.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>Correlation</h2>
            <p><b>Correlation</b> is the measure of how much one set of values depends on another. If values increase together, they are positively correlated. If values from one set increase as the other decreases, they are negatively correlated. There is no correlation when a change in one set has nothing to do with a change in the other.</p>

            <h2>Data Exploration</h2>
            <p>The part of the data science process where you ask a million basic questions that helps to understand the context of a data set. What you learn during the exploration phase will guide more in-depth analysis later. Further, it helps you recognize when a result might be surprising and warrant further investigation. Processing 900 different basic questions helps to find the one or two key stories in the data.</p>

            <h2>Data Mining</h2>
            <p>The process of pulling actionable insight out of a set of data and putting it to good use. This includes everything from cleaning and organizing the data, to analyzing it to find meaningful patterns and connections, to communicating those connections in a way that helps decision-makers improve their product or organization.</p>

            <h2>Data Pipelines</h2>
            <p>A collection of scripts or functions that pass data along in a series. The output of the first method becomes the input of the second. This continues until the data is appropriately cleaned and transformed for whatever task a team is working on.</p>

            <h2>Data Wrangling</h2>
            <p>The process of taking data in its original form and “taming” it until it works better in a broader workflow or project. Taming means making values consistent with a larger data set, replacing or removing values that might affect analysis or performance later, etc. When creating any data visualization there will always be some data wrangling required. </p>

An advantage Density Plots have over Histograms is that they're better at determining the distribution shape because they're not affected by the number of bins used (each bar used in a typical histogram).</p>

            <h2>Dot Maps</h2>
            <p><b>Dot Maps</b> (a.k.a Point Map, Dot Distribution Map, Dot Density Map) are a way of detecting spatial patterns or the distribution of data over a geographical region, by placing equally sized points over a geographical region. There are two types of Dot Map: one-to-one (one point represents a single count or object) and one-to-many (one point represents a particular unit, e.g. 1 point = 10 trees). Dot Maps are ideal for seeing how things are distributed over a geographical region and can reveal patterns when the points cluster on the map. Dot Maps are easy to grasp and are better at giving an overview of the data, but are not great for retrieving exact values.</p>

This type of diagram is used to show the sequential steps of a process. Flow Charts map out a process using a series of connected symbols, which makes the process easy to understand and aids in its communication to other people. Flow Charts are useful for explaining how a complex and/or abstract procedure, system, concept or algorithm work. Drawing a Flow Chart can also help in planning and developing a process or improving an existing one.</p>

            <h2>Gantt chart </h2>
            <p>Commonly used as an organizational tool for project management, <b>Gantt Charts</b> display a list of activities (or tasks) with their duration over time, showing when each activity starts and ends. This makes Gantt Charts useful for planning and estimating how long an entire project might take. You can also see what activities are running in parallel to each other. Gantt Charts are drawn within a table: rows are used for the activities and columns are used as the timescale. The duration of each activity is represented by the length of a bar plotted along this timescale. The start of the bar is the beginning of the activity and the end of the bar is when the activity should finish. Color-coding the bars can be used to categorize the activities into groups. To show the percentage of completion of an activity, a bar can be partially filled in, shaded differently or use a different color, to differentiate between what is done and what is left to do. Connecting arrows can be used to show which tasks are dependent on each other. Critical paths, the key activities required to finish the project can also be displayed with a series of highlighted arrows. Symbols can also be placed within a Gantt Chart to signify milestones and a vertical line running through the chart is used to highlight the current date.</p>

            <h2>Heatmaps</h2>        
            <p><b>Heatmaps</b> visualize data through variations in coloring. When applied to a tabular format, Heatmaps are useful for cross-examining multivariate data, through placing variables in the rows and columns and coloring the cells within the table. Heatmaps are good for showing variance across multiple variables, revealing any patterns, displaying whether any variables are similar to each other, and for detecting if any correlations exist in-between them. Typically, all the rows are one category (labels displayed on the left or right side) and all the columns are another category (labels displayed on the top or bottom). The individual rows and columns are divided into the subcategories, which all match up with each other in a matrix. The cells contained within the table either contain color-coded categorical data or numerical data, that is based on a color scale. The data contained within a cell is based on the relationship between the two variables in the connecting row and column.</p>

            <p>A <b>Histogram</b> visualizes the distribution of data over a continuous interval or certain time period. Each bar in a histogram represents the tabulated frequency at each interval/bin. Histograms help give an estimate as to where values are concentrated, what the extremes are and whether there are any gaps or unusual values. They are also useful for giving a rough view of the probability distribution.</p>

            <h2>Kagi charts</h2>
            <p>Kagi charts are used to display the general levels of supply and demand of a particular asset by visualizing the price actions through a series of line patterns. Kagi Charts are time-independent and help filter out the noise that can occur on other financial charts (like on a Candlestick Chart). This is so that important price movements are displayed more clearly. Recognizing the patterns that occur in Kagi Charts is key to understanding them. While Kagi Charts do display dates or time on their x-axis, these are in fact markers for the key price action dates and are not part of a timescale. The y-axis on the right-hand side is used as the value scale.</p>

            <h2>Line Graphs</h2>
            <p>Line Graphs are used to display quantitative values over a continuous interval or time period. A Line Graph is most frequently used to show trends and analyze how the data has changed over time. Line Graphs are drawn by first plotting data points on a Cartesian coordinate grid, then connecting a line between all of these points. Typically, the y-axis has a quantitative value, while the x-axis is a timescale or a sequence of intervals. 
            </p>
            <p class="visually-hidden">
              Negative values can be displayed below the x-axis. The direction of the lines on the graph works as a nice metaphor for the data: an upward slope indicates where values have increased and a downward slope indicates where values have decreased. The line's journey across the graph can create patterns that reveal trends in a dataset. 
              When grouped with other lines (other data series), individual lines can be compared to one another. However, avoid using more than 3-4 lines per graph, as this makes the chart more cluttered and harder to read. A solution to this is to divide the chart into smaller multiples (have a small Line Graph for each data series).

            <img src="https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/top_images/marimekko_chart.png">
            <p>Marimekko Charts (a.k.a Mosaic Plot) are used to visualize categorical data over a pair of variables. In a Marimekko Chart, both axes are variable with a percentage scale, that determines both the width and height of each segment. So Marimekko Charts work as a kind of two-way 100% Stacked Bar Graph. This makes it possible to detect relationships between categories and their subcategories via the two axes. The main flaws of Marimekko Charts are that they can be hard to read, especially when there are many segments. Also, it’s hard to accurately make comparisons between each segment, as they are not all arranged next to each other along a common baseline. Therefore, Marimekko Charts are better suited for giving a more general overview of the data.</p>

            <h2>Mean</h2>
            <p><b>Mean</b> (a.k.a Average) A calculation that gives us a sense of a “typical” value for a group of numbers. The mean is the sum of a list of values divided by the number of values in that list. It can be deceiving used on its own, and in practice we use the mean with other statistical values to gain intuition about our data.</p>

            <h2>Median</h2>
            <p>In a set of values listed in order, the <b>median</b> is whatever value is in the middle. We often use the median along with the mean to judge if there are values that are unusually high or low in the set. This is an early hint to explore outliers.</p>

            <h2>Moving average</h2>
            <p><b>Moving average</b> is a method of drawing a smooth trend line by calculating a Y value for every X value by averaging the Y values of the n points leading to and including the X value. For example, in a timeline, a 50-day moving average, calculates the average value of the trailing 50 points (days) and uses that to draw the trend line.</p>

            <h2>Multi-set Bar Charts</h2>
            <p><b>Multi-set Bar Charts</b> (a.k.a Grouped Bar Chart or Clustered Bar Chart) is a variation of a Bar Chart used when two or more data series are plotted side-by-side and grouped together under categories, all on the same axis. Like a Bar Chart, the length of each bar is used to show discrete, numerical comparisons amongst categories. Each data series is assigned an individual color or a varying shade of the same color, in order to distinguish them. Each group of bars are then spaced apart from each other. The use of Multi-set Bar Charts is usually to compare grouped variables or categories to other groups with those same variables or category types. Multi-set Bar Charts can also be used to compare mini Histograms to each other, so each bar in the group would represent the significant intervals of a variable. The downside of Multi-set Bar Charts is that they become harder to read the more bars you have in one group.</p>

            <h2>Network diagram</h2>
            <p>Network diagram (a.k.a Network Graph, Network Map, Node-Link Diagram) This type of visualization shows how things are interconnected through the use of nodes / vertices and link lines to represent their connections and help illuminate the type of relationships between a group of entities. Typically, nodes are drawn as little dots or circles, but icons can also be used. Links are usually displayed as simple lines connected between the nodes. However, in some Network Diagrams, not all of the nodes and links are created equally: additional variables can be visualized, for example, by making the node size or link stroke weight proportion to an assigned value. By mapping out connected systems, Network Diagrams can be used to interpret the structure of a network through looking for any clustering of the nodes, how densely nodes are connected or by how the diagram layout is arranged. The two notable types of Network Diagram are "undirected" and "directed". Undirected Network Diagrams only display the connections between entities, while directed Network Diagrams show if the connections are one-way or two-way through small arrows. Network Diagrams have a limited data capacity and start to become hard to read when there are too many nodes and resemble "hairballs".</p>

            <p>This chart was famously used by statistician and medical reformer Florence Nightingale to communicate the avoidable deaths of soldiers during the Crimean war. <br>Nightingale Rose Charts are drawn on a polar coordinate grid. Each category or interval in the data is divided into equal segments on this radial chart. How far each segment extends from the centre of the polar axis depends on the value it represents. So each ring from the centre of the polar grid can be used as a scale to plot the segment size and represent a higher value. Therefore, it’s important to notice with Nightingale Rose Charts that it’s the area, rather than the radius of a segment that represents its value. <br>The major flaw with Nightingale Rose Charts is that the outer segments are given more emphasis because of their larger area size. This disproportionately represents increases in value.</p>

              <p>A <b>Population Pyramid</b> is a pair of back-to-back Histograms (for each sex) that displays the distribution of a population in all age groups and in both sexes. The X-axis is used to plot population numbers and the Y-axis lists all age groups. Population Pyramids are ideal for detecting changes or differences in population patterns. The shape of a Population Pyramid can be used to interpret a population. For example, a pyramid with a very wide base and a narrow top section suggests a population with both high fertility and death rates. Whereas, a pyramid with a wider top half and a narrower base would suggest an ageing population with low fertility rates.</p>

Ideal for comparing the total amounts across each group/segmented bar. (b)100% Stack Bar Graphs show the percentage-of-the-whole of each group and are plotted by the percentage of each value to the total amount in each group. This makes it easier to see the relative differences between quantities in each group. Note:One major flaw of Stacked Bar Graphs is that they become harder to read the more segments each bar has. Also comparing each segment to each other is difficult, as they're not aligned on a common baseline.</p></li>

Place values are shown ascending downwards on a "stem" column, typically but not always in tens. Data that is within each place value is listed and extends sideways from it as a "leaf".</p>

                  <p>A Timeline is a graphical way of displaying a list of events in chronological order. Some timelines work on a scale, while others simply display events in sequence. If scale-based, a Timeline allows you to see when things occur or are to occur, by allowing the viewer to assess the time intervals between events.</p>

                    <p><b>Tree Diagram</b> is a way of visually representing hierarchy in a tree-like structure. Typically the structure of a Tree Diagram consists of elements such as a root node, a member that has no superior/parent. Then there are the nodes, which are linked together with line connections called branches that represent the relationships and connections between the members. Finally, the leaf nodes (or end-nodes) are members who have no children or child nodes.</p>

                    <h2>Treemaps</h2>
                    <img src="https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/top_images/treemap.png">
                    <p><b>Treemaps</b> are an alternative way of visualising the hierarchical structure of a Tree Diagram while also displaying quantities for each category via area size. Each category is assigned a rectangle area with their subcategory rectangles nested inside of it. When a quantity is assigned to a category, its area size is displayed in proportion to that quantity and to the other quantities within the same parent category in a part-to-whole relationship. Ben Shneiderman originally developed Treemaps as a way of visualizing a vast file directory on a computer, without taking up too much space on the screen. This makes Treemaps a more compact and space-efficient option for displaying hierarchies, that gives a quick overview of the structure. The downside to a Treemap is that it doesn't show the hierarchal levels as clearly as other charts that visualize hierarchal data (such as a Tree Diagram or Sunburst Diagram).</p>
                    
                    <p class="visually-hidden">Also, the area size of the parent category is the total of its subcategories. If no quantity is assigned to a subcategory, then it's area is divided equally amongst the other subcategories within its parent category. The way rectangles are divided and ordered into sub-rectangles is dependent on the tiling algorithm used. Many tiling algorithms have been developed, but the "squarified algorithm" which keeps each rectangle as square as possible is the one commonly used. </p>

                    <li><h2>Trellis</h2>
                      <p>A <b>trellis chart</b> is a grid of small charts, often called ‘small multiples’, and is basically a repetition of a chart across a grid. This grid usually is defined by the number of dimension values and organized in a way that either is a complete square (with leftovers) or another determined pattern (meaning a defined height/width).</p>

                      <h2>Venn Diagram</h2>
                      <p>A <b>Venn Diagram</b> is a diagram that visually displays all the possible logical relationships between a collection of sets. Each set is typically represented with a circle. Contained within each set is a collection of objects or entities that all have something in common. When sets overlap, it’s known as the intersection area. This is where entities that have all the qualities of the overlapping sets.</p>

                      <h2>Violin Plot</h2>
                      <p>Violin Plot is used to visualize the distribution of the data and its probability density. This chart is a combination of a Box Plot and a Density Plot that is rotated and placed on each side, to show the distribution shape of the data. The white dot in the middle is the median value and the thick black bar in the center represents the <i>interquartile range</i>. The thin black line extended from it represents the upper (max) and lower (min) adjacent values in the data. Box Plots are limited in their display of the data, as their visual simplicity tends to hide significant details about how values in the data are distributed. For example, with Box Plots, you can't see if the distribution is bimodal or multi-modal (seriously!). While Violin Plots display more information, they can be noisier than a Box Plot.</p>

All the words are then arranged in a cluster or cloud of words. Typically, Word Clouds are used on websites or blogs to depict keyword or tag usage. Word Clouds can also be used to compare two different bodies of text together.</p>

                        <p>An <b>XY chart</b> is a visualization that specializes in studying the relationship between numeric variables. Data is shown as a graph where points are drawn based on two variables in the data (two fields or calculations). A Bubble Chart is a specialized kind of XY chart in which a third variable is represented by varying the area of the points (bubbles) based on the value of the third variable. Category data can also be presented by varying the color or shape of the points.</p>
