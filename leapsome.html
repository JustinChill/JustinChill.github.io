  <h1>The Evolution of Data Visualizations</h1>
  <h2 class="subtitle caps"></h2>
</header>

<p>With complex information all around us, graphics have become indispensable to our daily lives. Navigation apps show real-time, interactive traffic data. A color-coded map of exit polls details election results down to the county level. Charts communicate stock market trends, government spending, and the dangers of epidemics. In this blog post, I'll explore the history of data visualizations and share tips on effectively communicating your message with charts.</p>

<h3>Exploratory vs. Explanatory</h3>
<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/52f42657e4b0b3416ff6b831/ee915aad-1398-4351-9f2a-35d4a34e2f75/ltJ5kWs.jpeg?content-type=image%2Fjpeg" loading="lazy">
<figcaption>Image from <a href="https://www.juiceanalytics.com/writing/exploratory-vs-explanatory-understanding-the-difference-between-data-analysis-and-data-presentation">Juice Analytics</a></figcaption>
<p>In her book ‚ÄúStorytelling with Data<a href="#cole" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="cole-ref"></a>,‚Äù Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic points out that there are really two kinds of data visualizations: <strong>exploratory</strong> and <strong>explanatory</strong>. Exploratory analysis is what you do to understand and get familiar with your data and generate information. Whether you start out with a hypothesis or question or are just exploring the data to see what might be interesting about it, during exploratory analysis, you are concerned with finding relationships between variables as well as identifying patterns and outliers.</p>
<p>Explanatory analysis, by contrast, is what you do once you have found something interesting and want to know more about it. During explanatory analysis, you focus on what has happened (information) and why it happened (knowledge). The key outputs of explanatory analysis are insights that, if used to guide decision-making and actions, ultimately become wisdom.</p>
<p>Knaflic describes exploratory analysis as hunting for pearls in oysters. ‚ÄúWe might have to open 100 oysters (test 100 different hypotheses or look at the data in 100 different ways) to find perhaps two pearls. When we are at the point of communicating our analysis to our audience, we really want to be in the explanatory space, meaning you have a specific thing you want to explain, a specific story you want to tell ‚Äì probably about those two pearls‚Äù.</p>

<h3>John Snow, 19th Century</h3>
<img src="https://www.data-viz.com/content/images/2022/11/image-8.png" loading="lazy">
<p>In the nineteenth century, cholera was ravaging London. British physician John Snow, already an esteemed doctor at Westminster Hospital, didn't buy the common theory of the time that "bad air" was responsible for the disease. By talking to local residents, he found the source of the outbreak was the public water pump on Broad Street. In his map of the city, Snow indicated cases of cholera as black tick marks. The marks clustered around water pumps, showing a correlation between cases and contaminated drinking water.</p>
<p>Opting to use a simple map to show his findings helped change public opinion and led to changes in the water and sewage systems of London. This led to similar changes in other cities, and a great improvement in general public health around the world.<a href="#snow" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="snow-ref"></a></p>

<h3>Charles Minard, Napoleon‚Äôs Campaign</h3>
<img src="https://image.sciencenorway.no/1618713.webp?imageId=1618713&x=0&y=0&cropw=100&croph=100&width=1058&height=504" loading="lazy">
<p>If John Snow presented his findings in a straightforward, explanatory way, Charles Minard offers an opposite, exploratory, visualization in his 1869 map of Napoleon‚Äôs 1812 infamous Russian campaign. It shows how the army which, at the border to Russia at the start of June 1812, comprised of 422,000 men who suffered great defeats during the course of the campaign under Napoleon‚Äôs leadership. After he was forced to turn back at Moscow with his remaining 100,000 soldiers, his army then totaled just 10,000 soldiers when he arrived back at his point of departure a half year after they started.</p>
<p>The route east towards Moscow is drawn as a beige line, whilst the return is marked out in black. 
The width of the line indicates the number of men, and this diminishes dramatically in the months before December, when the army reaches the river Neman, at the Polish-Russian border.</p>

<h3>The Health & Wealth of Nations</h3>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Ia5O2GS5Sw" title="The Health & Wealth of Nations, YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>The third data visualization example comes from professor of global health Hans Rosling as part of a captivating <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen">TED talk</a> delivered in 2016. Showing a graph of income per capita vs life expectancy at birth, Rosling demonstrates the epic proportions of human advancement in the last 180 years or so. While demonstrating the changes on his graphs, he delivers a rapid-fire description of the major political choices and world forces that are driving the change. Some of these include the rise of industrialism bringing up life expectancy in the rich world, China‚Äôs successful health measures under Mao, and then their subsequent economic rise under Deng Xiaoping. The AIDS epidemic in the '90s drags down the life expectancy of most of the sub-Saharan African nations. He ends in 2018 with a profoundly accurate ‚Äú...and we have a completely new world.‚Äù<a href="#rosling" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="rosling-ref"></a></p>
<p>The choice by Rosling to use animated bubble charts is profound. By using a form of chart that most of his audience will be familiar with, he presents his data in a clear way without taxing the reader. Encoding different dimensions of the data, such as color coding the countries by region of the world and the size of the population as the size of the circles, allows him to share fairly dense statistical information in a straightforward way. The use of motion adds whimsy and engagement to his presentation while also encoding another dimension, that of time.</p>

<h3>Business Intelligence (BI) Dashboards</h3>
<img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/630f7eedf78ec082332cf4e6/630f8166eeff72138f7a3350_01-Example-of-Trevor.io-BI-dashboard.jpg.png" loading="lazy">
<p>BI dashboards are much more than a visual representation of your data. They offer powerful, at-a-glance, dynamic snapshots of your performance based on KPIs. They can also help you identify your strengths and areas of opportunity. BI dashboards come in all shapes and sizes. Some examples may include supply planning, customer or HR demographics, sales KPIs, crucial financial metrics, or performance forecasting.</p>
<p>These dashboard have a number of advantages in an organization, such as:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Align teams and goals.</strong> People perform better when they have clear objectives. Sharing KPIs in a centralized dashboard help to organize people and teams in pursuit of a common goal.</li>
    <li><strong>Democratize data.</strong> Making data accessible to everyone despite their technical background shortens the decision-making process. It also reduces bottlenecks in your organization. </li>
    <li><strong>Provide context.</strong> Supporting an argument or decision with data helps to strengthen your case, especially when the decision may be different than what others were expecting.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>A BI dashboard is different from a regular data report because it is highly interactive. Reports are usually focused on metrics, while dashboards focus on insights. For example, a sales report can include the name of each customer, time on a page, and conversion information. A BI dashboard can include a summary of how many people converted after spending X amount of time on your page. Reports are usually presented in the form of tables while dashboards use visualizations.</p>

<div class="list">
  <p>Visualizing data is an important aspect of presenting insights clearly. But it's not always easy to create an effective visualization that people will understand at a glance. Following these best practices will help ensure that your visualizations are clear and informative, and that your insights land as intended.</p>
  <h3>Visualization best practices:</h3>

  <ul>
    <div>
      <li>Keep it simple</li>
      <li>Use intuitive visual cues</li>
      <li>Avoid distracting elements</li>
      <li>Use effective labels</li>
      <li>Test data visualizations with users</li>
    </div>
    <div>
      <li>Tell a story</li>
      <li>Use data points carefully</li>
      <li>Use visual hierarchy</li>
      <li>Continuously iterate and improve</li>
    </div>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Thank you for reading! I hope this blog post has helped to improve your understanding of how to effectively communicate your data. I look forward to the opportunity to bring this analytical approach to Leapsome and continue building on the great insights we can offer our customers!</p>
