      <figure class="mid-size" id="cadence" aria-label="A line graph showing..."></figure>
      <p>The launch on June 4th, 2010 of a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, in Florida, is a turning point in the development of private space flight. Though the industry's coming of age is still some way in the future, this launch marks its transition from childhood to adolescence.</p>
      <p>The chart above shows the accumulated launches SpaceX did in a given year, by the days elapsed since year start. It is useful for extrapolating launch cadence to total yearly launch count. </p>
      <p>Other rockets of this class, such as Boeing's Delta IV and the Atlas V, operated jointly by Boeing and Lockheed Martin, are children of the military-industrial complex. Though built by private firms, they are the result of taxpayer-financed programs, often on a “cost-plus” basis. By contrast SpaceX, though buoyed by billion dollar contracts with NASA to fly missions to the international space station, had to raise the initial development money itself. That money came primarily from Mr. Musk.</p>
      <p>The important point about Falcon 9, so called because its lift-off is propelled by nine of SpaceX's proprietary Merlin rocket motors, is that it is powerful enough to put people into orbit. Other private space companies are either restricted to launching small, unmanned satellites (Orbital Sciences Corporation's <a href="https://www.northropgrumman.com/space/pegasus-rocket">Pegasus</a>, for example), or—in the case of Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic—hope to take tourists on suborbital hops to briefly experience zero gravity.</p>
      <p>The vehicle itself is a two-stage affair. The heavy lifting is done by the nine-engine cluster, fueled by kerosene and liquid oxygen. That burns for three (3) minutes, before being jettisoned. The payload, a capsule known as Dragon, is then carried into orbit by a single-Merlin-engined second stage that burns for an additional six (6) minutes. The unmanned version of that capsule is designed to accommodate six tons of cargo for the inhabitants of the space station, or could be replaced by satellites, if that is what the client wants.</p>
      <h2>Reusability</h2>

The background features a path of smoke indicating a loop in the sky. The cartoon conveys a sense of triumph and innovation." loading="lazy" />

      <p>Everything about space flight is extreme. Even relatively modest rockets are hundreds of feet high. The biggest (the Saturn V, which launched astronauts to the Moon) remains the most powerful vehicle ever built. But space flight is extremely expensive, too. One reason is that is that, despite all their technological sophistication, rockets are one-shot wonders. After they have fired their engines for a few minutes they are left to fall back to Earth, usually splashing ignominiously into the ocean.</p>
      <p>Making something able to fly more than once would slash the cost of getting into space. The furthest advanced at this technology by far is SpaceX.History however, hints that reusability is difficult to do properly. The space shuttle itself, for instance, was intended to fly every week. In the end, it made only 135 trips over the course of 30 years.<a href="#STS" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="STS-ref"></a> </p>
      <h3>Booster reuse</h3>
      <figure id="boosterReuse" aria-label="A line graph showing..."></figure>
      <h2>Starship</h2>
      <p>Starship is the world’s largest rocket. It consists of two parts: the Super Heavy booster stage, a behemoth 71 meters tall with 33 engines, and the 50 meters Starship upper stage. On Starship’s first two test flights it failed to reach orbit; it managed on the third, in March, but then broke apart while re-entering the atmosphere.</p>
