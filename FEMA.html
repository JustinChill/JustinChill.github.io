      <p>Long before the sun rose the waters came rushing. Heavy rain swelled the rivers in Texas’s hill country until they burst their banks, drowning people, cars and trailers before dawn on July 4<sup>th</sup>. 135 people died, including at least 71 adults and 37 children. The number of people still missing in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/us/politics/texas-floods-hearing.html">Kerr County</a> has remained at two after falling from nearly one hundred. More than two dozen of the dead are children and counsellors from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp for girls whose cabins dotted the bank of the Guadalupe River. What can be done to mitigate such tragedy?</p>
      <p>Floods occur naturally and can happen almost anywhere. They may not even happen near a body of water, although river and coastal flooding are two of the most common types. Heavy rains, poor drainage, and even nearby construction projects can increase the risk and severity of flood damage.<a href="#FEMA" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="FEMA-ref"></a></p>
      <p>Your chances of flooding are higher than the average wildfire risk. Floods cause $40 billion dollars (2015 USD) in damages annually and affected 2.5 billion people between 1994 and 2014<a href="#nature" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="nature-ref"></a>. Most homeowners insurance excludes flood damage, making flood insurance essential. <a href="https://agents.floodsmart.gov/sites/default/files/fema_nfip-summary-coverage-brochure-12-2023.pdf#page=2" target="_blank">Official definition of a flood</a>.</p>
      <p>A key factor in understanding and mitigating impacts from flooding is knowing where flooding occurs on a regular basis. Accurate flood extent mapping provides essential data for various purposes. It helps urban planners design resilient infrastructure, aids in developing early warning systems for communities, and supports insurance companies and policymakers in assessing risks and allocating resources.</p>
      <p>By understanding past flooding events, communities can better prepare for future occurrences, leading to safer and more resilient living environments. While mapping flood extent is important, doing this via on-the-ground efforts is often challenging, especially in developing countries, where resources for this time-intensive work are scarce. In addition, ground-based assessments are often for small areas.</p>
      <h3>Flood maps</h3>
      <span class="header-tag mid-size"><img src="imgs/tag.svg" alt="Chart header tag"></span>
      <h3 class="mid-size">Coastal flooding</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Flood maps help mortgage lenders determine insurance requirements and help communities develop strategies for reducing their risk. The mapping process a community understand their flood risk and make more informed decisions about how to reduce or manage that risk.</p>
      <p>Flood maps are one tool that communities use to know which areas have the highest risk of flooding. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, <small>FEMA</small>, maintains and updates data through flood maps and risk assessments.</p>
      <div class="fema-callout rounded"><img src="https://www.fema.gov/profiles/femad8_gov/themes/fema_uswds/images/arrow.svg" alt="alert - info">
        <p><strong>Flood maps show how likely it is for an area to flood.</strong> <br />Any place with a 1% or higher chance of experiencing a flood each year is considered to have a high risk. Those areas have at least a one-in-four chance of flooding during a 30-year mortgage.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Through Risk Mapping, Assessment and Planning (Risk <abbr title="Mapping, Assessment and Planning">MAP</abbr>)&nbsp;, <small>FEMA</small> is updating the nation’s coastal&nbsp;Flood Insurance Studies (FIS)&nbsp;and&nbsp;Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs, or flood maps), where appropriate, and publishing new flood maps of densely populated areas that were not previously mapped. With these new and updated maps, communities can make floodplain management decisions based on the best available scientific information.</p>
      <h2>Coastal flooding</h2>
      <p>Coastal flooding is when water inundates or covers normally dry coastal land as a result of high or rising tides or storm surges. </p>
      <p>In <small>FEMA</small>'s <a href="https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/coastal-flooding">National Risk Index</a>, a <code>Coastal Flooding Risk Index</code> score and rating represent a community's relative risk for coastal flooding as compared to the rest of the United States. A <code>Coastal Flooding Expected Annual Loss</code> score and rating represent a community's relative level of expected building and population loss each year due to coastal flooding when compared to the rest of the United States.</p>
      <p>On December 12, 2024, <small>FEMA</small> launched a prototype of the <a href="https://eelp.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NRI_Future_Risk_Technical_Document.pdf">Future Risk Index</a> showing projected economic losses due to climate change at the county level, based on different greenhouse gas emission scenarios and environmental hazards (coastal flooding, extreme heat, wildfire, hurricanes, and drought). The Index was the first free, publicly available tool showing how much climate change is likely to cost communities in the United States. The Future Risk Index was designed as a supplement to <a href="https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/"><small>FEMA</small>’s National Risk Index</a>, which includes criteria on social vulnerability and community resilience.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the population of people living in flood-prone areas is increasing due to migration and population growth. All of these impacts are expected to become even more severe with climate change.</p>

      <p><span>When natural disasters or other emergencies strike, it’s crucial to </span><b><span>rapidly collect and downlink imagery from the area</span></b><span>. Relief organizations use these images to create maps, plan the allocation of relief resources, consider the status of critical infrastructure, choose suitable evacuation routes, and help the efficient deployment of disaster response teams.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p><span>Using satellite images during emergencies can help </span><b><span>answer questions</span></b><span> such as:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span>How many disaster responders are needed in each area?</span></li>
        <li><span>Which evacuation routes are currently obstructed?</span></li>
        <li><span>Is this location suitable for a helicopter landing?</span></li>
        <li><span>How many people need to be evacuated?</span></li>
        <li><span>Where can we establish temporary medical facilities?</span></li>
        <li><span>In which direction is the fire progressing?</span></li>
        <li><span>Are there any disruptions to water supply systems?</span></li>
        <li><span>Were power lines damaged?</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>After the emergency: damage assessment </h3>
      <p>If you manually surveyed areas devastated by natural disasters, it would take days. That’s why analysts often use  satellite images to assess the extent and magnitude of damage and <strong>create damage maps</strong>. With access to a satellite imagery archive, it’s easy to compare images of the area from before and after the event, which helps emergency management organizations quickly understand the effect of the emergency and its impact on the environment.</p>

      </ul>
      <h4>SWOT analysis</h4>
      <p><strong>Strengths</strong>: As a robust geospatial platform with custom workflows, Forerunner allows communities to easily digitize and automate their disaster recovery processes. Governments can manage environmental hazards, community feedback, grants, permits, citizen mailings, and custom objects in one integrated platform. </p>
      <p><strong>Weakness</strong>: Dependent on data from FEMA, subject to <a href="https://eelp.law.harvard.edu/tracker/rollback-fema-removed-future-risk-index/">the whims</a> of the current administration. <em>The FIRM data that populates Forerunner's Property Info Panel and Map is pulled directly and regularly from FEMA's Map Service Center.</em></p>
      <p><strong>Opportunities</strong>: Leverage current expertise in mapping and community safety to include new geographies, additional environmental hazards and risk models. Low-cost <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/science-enabling-technology/technology-highlights/big-weather-data-from-tiny-cubesat/">satellites</a> can offer additional data streams with greater reliability.</p>
      <p><strong>Threats</strong>: The emergency management sales cycle, especially in the gov-tech space, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world/">notoriously difficult</a>. Palantir already has a significant and long-standing relationship with the U.S. government, providing software and data analytics solutions to various agencies, including <a href="https://www.palantir.com/assets/xrfr7uokpv1b/1EE4kLUXymcHCQ68Xo2OzQ/8cbc5cc985ff4c3cddffdeb292c2967a/Emergency_Preparedness__Response__and_Recovery.pdf">emergency preparedness and disaster recovery planning</a>.</p>
