      <p>According to WebAIM’s 2024 findings, <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/#:~:text=96.3%25%20of%20home,was%20certainly%20lower.">95.9% of website homepages fail basic accessibility checks</a>.</p>
      <p>By making a website accessible to everyone, you can tap into a hidden market of website users with disabilities, which is estimated at $18tn worldwide, according to <a href="https://www.rod-group.com/research-insights/annual-report-2024/">The 2024 Global Economics of Disability Report</a>. Besides the economic value, being accessible can make your site easier to use for all visitors, improve your SEO, and protect yourself from <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/08/31/lawsuits-over-disabled-americans-access-to-websites-have-surged">potential legal</a> issues.</p>
      <p>Accessibility is something you have to continuously strive for. There is no simple "yes" or "no" answer to a question that considers the sheer diversity of abilities, devices, assistive technologies, and individual use cases. What seems accessible to a sighted user might be completely inaccessible to a non-sighted user. And even if you optimize for various screen readers, you still have to account for low-level vision, color blindness, hearing impairments, mobility impairments, and more<a href="#A11Y" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="A11Y-ref"></a>.</p>
      <p>Justin Chill is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities. I believe that all persons should be able to access my site, and I am continually improving the user experience for everyone by applying the latest relevant accessibility standards.</p>
      <p>What does “everyone” mean? Let’s break it down. I'm talking about making websites work for <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health">1.3 billion people globally who have disabilities</a>, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>People who are <a href="https://www.a11y-collective.com/blog/blind-website-accessibility/">blind or have low vision</a>.</li>

        <li>People who are deaf or hard of hearing.</li>

        <li>People with motor or physical disabilities.</li>

        <li>People with cognitive or learning disabilities.</li>

        <li>People with neurological conditions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But accessibility helps many others, too. Think about older adults who might struggle with small text, someone with a broken arm who can’t use a mouse, or a person trying to watch a video in a noisy café. That’s why we call it <a href="https://www.a11y-collective.com/blog/universal-design-for-websites/">universal design</a> – it makes things better for everyone.</p>

      <h2>Measures to Support Accessibility</h2>
      <p>I am taking the following measures to ensure accessibility on my blog:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Completed web accessibility training classes.</li>
        <li>Include people with disabilities in my design personas.</li>
        <li>Regularly evaluate the website against current <a href="https://github.com/brunopulis/awesome-a11y/blob/main/topics/specification.md">WCAG</a> criteria.</li>
        <li>Ensure images and data visualizations are accessible.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Conformance Status</h2>
      <p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a>&nbsp;define requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.</p>
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1204692/30697506-9fd3020c-9eb5-11e7-95ca-a6c56785dd66.png" loading="lazy" alt="Hashtag a11y in graffiti style.">
      <h3>Additional Accessibility Considerations</h3>
      <p>Although my goal is WCAG 2.2 Level AA conformance, I have also applied some Level AAA Success Criteria:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Images of text are only used for decorative purposes or logos.</li>
        <li>Re-authentication, after a session expires, does not cause loss of data.</li>
        <li>Contrast ratios of at least 7:1 for all titles and article text</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Feedback</h2>
      <p>I welcome your feedback on the accessibility of my website! Please let me know if you encounter any accessibility barriers while browsing&nbsp;the site:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/JustinChill/JustinChill.github.io/issues">Issues</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Compatibility with Browsers and Assistive Technology</h2>
      <p>The JustinChill website&nbsp;is designed to be compatible with the following assistive technologies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google Chrome with VoiceOver on Mac OS 12 or later</li>
        <li>Google Chrome with NVDA on Windows 10 or 11</li>
        <li>Google Chrome with JAWS on Windows 10 or 11</li>
        <li>Safari with VoiceOver on iOS 15 or later</li>
        <li>Google Chrome with Talkback on Android 13</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The website&nbsp;may not be compatible with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Browsers older than three major versions or mobile operating systems older than three years</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Technical Specifications</h2>
      <p>The accessibility of JustinChill.com relies on the following technologies to work with the combination of web browsers and any assistive technologies or plugins installed on your computer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>WAI-ARIA</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These technologies are relied upon for conformance with the accessibility standards used.</p>
      <h2>Assessment Approach</h2>
      <p>I am currently assessing the accessibility of the website by utilizing the following approaches:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>External evaluation using automated scanning</li>
        <li>External evaluation using assistive technology</li>
        <li>External evaluation using manual assessment techniques</li>
        <li>External evaluation by users with document disabilities</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I recognize the need for all users, regardless of ability and device, to have undeterred access to the websites and posts I share here. This has been an important goal of my blog from the onset.</p>

        <p>The earlier you build accessibility into your process, the easier and more <a href="https://www.a11y-collective.com/blog/cost-of-ada-compliance/">cost-effective</a> it becomes. It’s like planning a building – adding ramps and lifts during construction is much simpler than trying to retrofit them later. The same applies to your website.</p><cite><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taekereijenga/">- Taeke Reijenga</a></cite>
