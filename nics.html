      <figure id="barplot" class="mid-size"
        aria-label="A bar graph titled Monthly Background Checks from 2000 to 2023. The graph shows a general upward trend, with notable spikes around events like Sandy Hook, San Bernardino, and January 6th. Total checks peak at over 4 million.">
        <figcaption class="mid-size right">Data: <a
            href="https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year_by_state_type.pdf/view">FBI.gov</a>

      <p>Following the implementation of <a href="https://www.atf.gov/rules-and-regulations/brady-law">the Brady act</a>
        in 1994, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (<small>FBI</small>) developed a system to conduct background
        checks on those wishing to obtain a firearm. The system known as the <strong>National Instant Criminal
          Background Check System</strong> (<small>NICS</small>) was created in collaboration with the Bureau of
        Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and local law enforcement agencies.</p>
      <p>Since it's inception in November 1998, the <small>FBI</small> has released monthly data from each state and U.S
        territory. The <small>FBI</small> claims that over 300 million requests have been approved, and 1.5 million have
        been denied.</p>
      <p>The <small>FBI</small>'s background check numbers come with caveats. These numbers show only the number of
        firearm background checks initiated through the <small>NICS</small>. <strong>They don't represent</strong> the
        number of firearms sold.</p>
      <p>Due to varying state laws a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a
        firearm sale. Kentucky runs a new check on each concealed carry license holder each month. And of course, the
        <small>FBI</small>’s numbers don’t include private gun sales, many of which do not require a background check.
      </p>

      <h3><small>NICS</small> Background Checks - past 36 months</h3>
      <figure id="recent"
        aria-label="Area chart showing NICS background checks over the past 36 months. Spikes correlate with major events like the COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest.">
        <figcaption class="right">Data: <a

      </figure>

      <p>The data suggest that Americans’ interest in guns surged in 2020, coinciding with major world events. Numbers
        spiked in March as the coronavirus outbreak spread and Americans worried that the government might be unable to
        cope with increased crime caused by economic hardships or, conversely, that lockdowns would be an excuse to
        enact stricter gun control. The designation of gun shops as “essential” in some states, allowing them to stay
        open during lockdowns, probably helped sales. They climbed again in June as the country was enveloped in chaos
        after the police killing of <a href="https://justinchill.com/8m46s.html">George Floyd</a>.</p>

        otherwise ineligible to purchase a firearm<a href="#usaf" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="usaf-ref"></a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Prohibited Persons</h3>
      <p>The following groups are currently <a href="https://www.atf.gov/firearms/identify-prohibited-persons"
          target="_blank">prohibited</a> from owning guns:</p>
      <ul>
        <li data-block-key="au8h7">Convicted felons</li>
        <li data-block-key="f3ndn">People under federal domestic restraining orders</li>
        <li data-block-key="f92l1">People convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes against victims they have
          been married to, lived with, or had a child with</li>

        </li>
        <li data-block-key="ag5oc">Fugitives</li>
        <li data-block-key="arku">People convicted of drug crimes or determined to by a court to be addicted to an
          illegal controlled substance</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- <p>Starting in 2006 we can see a noticeable increase in the number of firearms checked processed for the state of Kansas. This is due to a <a href="https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/statutes/statute.aspx?id=47039">policy</a> change that requires automatic monthly background checks on every holder of concealed-carry permits in the commonwealth.</p> -->

      <h3>Transaction types</h3>
      <p>The <small>FBI</small> categorizes each background check by type of firearm:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Pre-Pawn—background checks requested by an officially-licensed FFL on prospective firearm transferees
          seeking to pledge or pawn a firearm as security for the payment or repayment of money, prior to actually
          pledging or pawning the firearm.</li>
        <li>Redemption—background checks requested by an officially-licensed FFL on prospective firearm transferees
          attempting to regain possession of a firearm after pledging or pawning a firearm as security at a pawn shop.
        </li>
        <li>Returned/Disposition—background checks requested by criminal justice/law enforcement agencies prior to
          returning a firearm in its possession to the respective transferee, to ensure the individual is not
          prohibited.</li>
        <li>Rentals—background checks requested by an officially-licensed FFL on prospective firearm transferees
          attempting to possess a firearm when the firearm is loaned or rented for use off the premises of the business.
        </li>
        <li>Private Sale—background checks requested by an officially-licensed FFL on prospective firearm transferees
          attempting to possess a firearm from a private party seller who is not an officially-licensed FFL.</li>
        <li>Return to Seller-Private Sale—background checks requested by an officially-licensed FFL on prospective
          firearm transferees attempting to possess a firearm from a private party seller who is not an
          officially-licensed FFL.</li>
      </ol>

          alt="A circular logo for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System features a map of the USA, a green handgun, and a large red check mark. It reads Federal Bureau of Investigation around the border."
          loading="lazy">Sourced from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and made
        accessible through Buzzfeed News' <a
          href="https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks?tab=readme-ov-file">data repository</a>,
        the data visualized here provides an important look into the demand of firearms in the United States.</p>
      <p>The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 played a significant role in this data collection process,
        facilitating the instant screening of prospective gun buyers to determine their eligibility for firearm
        ownership.</p>
      <p> Before a purchase is completed, sellers are required to contact NICS for a background check to ensure that the
        buyer does not have a criminal record, restraining orders, or other disqualifications, such as being a convicted
        felon or having a history of mental illness. </p>
      <p>The data derived from NICS checks offers important insights into the impact of these regulations on the
        firearms market and, by extension, discussions surrounding gun violence, gun control debates, and the gun
        production and market dynamics in the United States.</p>
