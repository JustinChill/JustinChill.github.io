      <figure id="line" aria-label="A line graph showing the decline in membership rates in unions in the United States. The x-asis starts at 1960 with a high of 29.3% and declines to 10.6% by 2018."></figure>
      <figcaption><a href="http://unionstats.gsu.edu/MonthlyLaborReviewArticle.htm">Data</a>: Barry T. Hirsch, David A. Macpherson, and Wayne G. Vroman, <em>“Estimates of Union Density by State</em>”</figcaption>
      <p>Participation in a labor union fell to 10.6 percent in 2018 among the American workforce, with all demographic groups seeing a decline in membership. The drop continues a trend that, except for a pause during the 2008 financial crisis, has been ongoing since the 1980s, when the share of organized labor was roughly double what it is today. In their heyday in the mid-1950s, more than 30% of workers were members of a union.</p>
      <p>The number of wage and salary workers belonging to unions, 14.7 million in 2018, was about the same as in 2017. In 1983, the first year for which comparable union data are available, the union membership rate was 20.1 percent and there were 17.7 million union workers. What will the consequences of even lower union membership be?</p>
      <p>“Workers want unions, but a broken system is undermining their efforts to organize at every turn,” said Heidi Shierholz, president of the Economic Policy Institute. “Employers have exploited weaknesses in U.S. labor law, and federal and state policymakers have failed to prevent this from happening.”</p>
      <p>A decline in numbers aside, unions carry outsized political clout, especially in states critical to the outcome of the presidential race like Michigan and Pennsylvania, where membership rates are higher than the national average. In Michigan, 12.8% of workers were in a union, down from 14% a year earlier, while in Pennsylvania union membership rates bucked the trend and rose to 12.9% from 12.7%<a href="#reuters" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="reuters-ref"></a>.</p>
      <p>2024 was the most active for organized labor walkouts in more than two decades, with 36 strikes that idled at least 1,000 workers at a time, the most since 2000, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics (<small>BLS</small>) data. In addition to the UAW strikes, Hollywood actors, screenwriters and directors all staged work stoppages of varying durations.</p>
