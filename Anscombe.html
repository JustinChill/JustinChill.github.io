  <p>Frank Anscombe was an English statistician who stressed the importance of computers being able to perform calculations <i>and</i> graph data visually. To illustrate his point he devised four data sets that appear nearly identical in tabular form, but have very different distributions and appear very different when graphed.

  <p>Anscombe's quartet is often used to illustrate the importance of looking at a set of data graphically before starting to analyze according to a particular type of relationship, and the inadequacy of basic statistic properties for describing realistic datasets.</p>
