      <h2>A new goal standard</h2>
      <figure id="step_chart"
        aria-label="Step chart comparing the cumulative goal scoring pace of Alex Ovechkin and Wayne Gretzky by age. It shows Ovechkin catching up to Gretzky's pace in his 30s.">
      </figure>
      <p>Alex Ovechkin, "Ovi" to fans, surpassed Wayne Gretzky, “the Great One”, to become the NHL's all-time leading
        goal scorer by netting his 895<sup>th</sup> career goal on April 6, 2025, during a game between the Washington
        Capitals and the New York Islanders at UBS Arena in New York. Ovechkin's record-breaking goal came via a
        signature power-play wrist shot from his favored spot on the ice, dubbed "Ovi's office", with assists from
        teammates, during the second period against goalie Ilya Sorokin. Remarkably, Ovechkin achieved this mark in
        exactly 1,487 games: the same number of games it took Gretzky to accumulate his 894 goals.</p>
      <p>Ovechkin’s proficiency is remarkable for two reasons. The first is his remarkable longevity. As shown in the
        chart above, a tracker of cumulative goals scored, Wayne Gretzky was far more effective at putting pucks in the
        net early in his career. Through age 29 Gretzky outperformed Ovi by a wide margin. No <small>NHL</small> player
        had ever scored more goals than Gretzky at <a href="https://stathead.com/sharing/Tr01r" target="_blank">19</a>,
        or <a href="https://stathead.com/sharing/1KjB4" target="_blank">20</a>, or—well, at 21, Gretzky scored <a
          href="https://records.nhl.com/records/skater-records/goals/skater-most-goals-one-season" target="_blank">more
          goals</a> than anyone else has scored in a single season at <em>any</em> age. He was on pace to become
        hockey’s most prolific career scorer from the second he set foot on the ice.</p>
      <span class="header-tag"><img src="imgs/tag.svg" alt="Chart header tag"></span>
      <h4>Ovechkin's scoring has remained remarkably consistent, while Gretzky faded with age</h4>
      <div class="player-portraits">
        <img src="https://cdn.nhlpa.com/players/headshots/classic/nid/450/8447400.webp" alt="Wayne Gretzky"
          title="Wayne Gretzky">
        <img src="https://cdn.nhlpa.com/players/headshots/classic/nid/450/8471214.webp" alt="Alex Ovechkin"
          title="Alex Ovechkin">
      </div>
      <figure id="age_chart"
        aria-label="Bar chart showing goals scored by age for Ovechkin and Gretzky. Ovechkin has maintained high goal totals into his late 30s, whereas Gretzky's production declined.">
      </figure>
      <p>In his 30s, though, Mr. Gretzky was scoring just a bit better than the league average. Other prolific goal
        scorers tend to experience similar declines, with their production dropping off as they advance along the aging
        curve<a href="#econ" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="econ-ref"></a>.</p>
      <p>Not Ovi. He was on track to be <em>one</em> of the greatest goal scorers ever, certainly. But <em>the</em>
        greatest of all time? No way. Why would anyone have expected him to overtake Gretzky? Even as his skating has
        slowed, he still has a stunning ability to read the play, find openings and fire off exquisitely placed shots.
      </p>
      <p>No one should have, but on Sunday, he did. Back in 2006, in just his second year in the <small>NHL</small>, he
        explained to reporters after a potential injury that he was fine, saying “<a
          href="https://russianmachineneverbreaks.com/tag/alex-ovechkin/"><em>Russian machine never breaks</em></a>”.
      </p>
      <p>That sums up his playing style as well as anyone can.</p>
      <p>The other thing to note out about Ovi’s scoring is the context of the <small>NHL</small>. Gretzky’s record had
        been expected to last partly because of all the changes to the sport of ice hockey since he played. Bigger
        goaltenders, tougher checking and more suffocating defensive systems have yielded fewer scoring opportunities.
        But that hasn't slowed Ovi (see chart 2).</p>
      <p>Gretzky’s most impressive record, for total points, which combines goals and assists, faces no threat
        whatsoever from Ovechkin. Mr. Gretzky had <strong>2,857</strong> career points. Mr. Ovechkin currently has
        1,619. With a good chance that next season will be his last in the <small>NHL</small>, Ovi will probably finish
        his career with around 40% fewer points than Gretzky.</p>
