      <p>After winning its bid for the 2016 Olympic Games seven years ago, Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro has undergone a construction boom, including new sports venues, subway connections, and more infrastructure. Though stymied in part by political scandal and a suffering economy, Rio largely completed its intended projects. Here are some of the biggest changes.</p>
      <h2>Line 4 Subway</h2>

People stand and walk nearby, and a bus on the road is visible. The area is fenced with graffiti on the barriers, and there are trees and a hill in the background.">

      <p>One of the flagship transportation efforts, Rio built a new<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/with-one-month-to-go-before-olympics-rio-officials-say-city-will-be-ready-1467732502"> subway extension </a> linking popular beach areas with the neighborhood where the Olympic Park is located. Though originally intended to open to the public ahead of the Games, repeated delays forced a later completion date than hoped and will only be open to athletes and Olympic spectators.</p>
      <h2>Favela in Barra da Tijuca</h2>

      <p>Once populated by some 550 families, Vila Autódromo <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/last-residents-leave-rio-barrio-as-olympics-approaches-1470274566">became a symbol</a> of the city’s alleged forced relocation of thousands of poor citizens from their homes to make way for the Olympics and 2014 World Cup. The city says Vila Autódromo’s residents benefited by receiving new housing from the government. While some evictions cleared space to build or expand infrastructure, activists and residents say the city’s only purpose in removing Vila Autódromo was to boost land values in the Olympic Park, which will be used for private real-estate development after the Games.</p>

      <p>Enormous investment <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/rio-projects-fail-to-reach-the-finish-line-1470154458">has been pumped</a> into transportation infrastructure projects throughout the city, including the VLT (light rail train), in the port district. The rail connects Rio’s domestic airport to a bus terminal and is aimed at revitalizing the area.</p>

      <p>The construction of the golf course has <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/local-golfers-test-rios-olympic-course-1457556279">stirred controversy</a>. Golf is not widely played in Brazil, and though there is one small public course on the northern outskirts of Rio, Brazilian officials have touted the fact that after the Olympics, the course would become the first professional-quality public course in Brazil. But it was partially built on a protected nature reserve, angering local activists. Organizers argued that enforcement of the area was so bad, turning it into a golf course actually improved the biodiversity of the site.</p>
