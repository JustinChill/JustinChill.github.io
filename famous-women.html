      <h3>Women of the world</h3>
      <figure id="imgs" aria-label="100 most popular women in history, organized by subject area."></figure>
      <p>Throughout history, courageous and visionary women have stepped up to lead movements that have transformed society. Over the years, these trailblazers have worked tirelessly in their own ways to make the world a better place and <a href="https://www.biography.com/womens-history">shape the course of history</a>, whether they were on <a href="https://www.biography.com/womens-rights-activists">the front lines of important protests</a>, representing their country at the Olympics, or inspiring fellow women to speak their own minds. They have all brought their innovative beliefs and talents to life with dedication, passion, and plenty of hard work. </p>
      <p>From influencing major <a href="https://www.biography.com/supreme-court-justices">Supreme Court</a> decisions or making history <a href="https://www.biography.com/academy-awards">at the Oscars</a> to being <a href="https://www.biography.com/history-culture/amelia-earhart">the first female pilot</a> to fly across the Atlantic Ocean or becoming the <a href="https://www.biography.com/activists/malala-yousafzai">world’s youngest Nobel Peace Prize recipient</a>, there are women from many time periods, backgrounds, and professions to demonstrate the scope of incredible female accomplishments. </p>
      <p>Maya Angelou, the legendary poet and civil rights <a href="https://www.discoverwalks.com/blog/world/55-most-inspiring-activists-around-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">activist</a> inspired millions with her words. Madame Curie’s groundbreaking research led to momentous discoveries in physics and chemistry. These trailblazers redefined the role of women as passive bystanders, paving the way for future generations to dream bigger. Coming from vastly different backgrounds, they were united by an unshakable conviction that a better, more equitable world was possible. Through their vision, courage, and perseverance in the face of adversities, these women left an indelible, progressive mark on history that continues to inspire people everywhere.</p>
      <h3>Grace Hopper (1906-1992)</h3>
      <img src="https://www.discoverwalks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/grace_hopper.jpg" alt="An elderly person in a U.S. Navy uniform stands in front of an American flag, wearing glasses and a decorated hat. They have a name tag that reads COMO HOPPER and several medals on their chest.">
      <p>Looking back in history, we find Grace Hopper: a pioneering computer scientist and <a href="https://www.discoverwalks.com/blog/united-states/20-famous-us-navy-seals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States Navy</a> rear admiral. She was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer in 1944. She worked on various early computers and made major contributions to developing software and programming languages. In 1959, Hopper created the first compiler, which translates written code into machine code. She also helped develop COBOL, an early programming language that is still used today. Hopper is credited with popularizing the idea of machine-independent programming languages. She was a strong leader who helped shape the field of computer science and paved the way for more women to enter technology and leadership roles.</p>
      <h3>Hedy Lamarr (1914-2000)</h3>
      <img src="https://www.discoverwalks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/819px-hedy_lamarr_-_1940-1.jpg" alt="Black and white portrait of a person with wavy dark hair and a contemplative expression, resting their arms on a surface. Theyre wearing a sleeveless top and looking slightly off-camera, with blinds in the background.">
      <p>Hedy Lamarr was an actress known for her beauty and acting talents, but she was also a brilliant inventor and leader in scientific innovation. During the <a href="https://www.discoverwalks.com/blog/world/women-of-world-war-i-all-you-need-to-know-about-their-role-in-the-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Second World War</a>, Lamarr helped develop a radio signaling technology that could guide torpedoes without the enemy intercepting messages. This “frequency-hopping” technology laid the foundation for many innovations we rely on today, like Wi-Fi, GPS, and Bluetooth. Though she did not receive recognition for her invention during her lifetime, her pioneering work opened doors for more women to enter STEM fields. Her tenacity and intelligence changed science and communications for generations.</p>
      <h3>Indira Gandhi (1917-1984)</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.discoverwalks.com/blog/india/interesting-facts-about-indira-gandhi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indira Gandhi</a>’s achievements in power made her a historical figure. She was the first and only female Prime Minister of India, serving four terms between 1966-1977 and 1980-1984. A towering world leader, she led India through periods of economic and social change as well as war. She nationalized banks to bring financial services to rural India and eliminated princely privileges to bring about equality. She both won and lost elections, showing her resiliency. Though criticized for the 1975-77 Emergency, she maintained strong diplomatic ties with the US and USSR. Her greatest moment came in 1971 when she led India to victory over Pakistan, creating Bangladesh and proving a woman could be Commander-in-Chief. Her strength, vision, and political prowess made her an exceptional, transformative female leader.</p>
      <h3>Katherine G. Johnson (1918-2020)</h3>
      <p>Katherine G. Johnson was a trailblazing African-American <a href="https://www.discoverwalks.com/blog/world/10-most-famous-nasa-scientists/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA</a> mathematician whose brilliant calculations were critical to early human spaceflight. During her three-and-a-half-decade career, Johnson hand-calculated complex orbital mechanics and flight trajectories for projects including Alan Shepard’s 1961 mission and the 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing. She displayed exceptional leadership by authoring or co-authoring twenty-six research reports, manually checking computer computations, and asserting the right for women to attend meetings. Johnson’s foundational work at NASA shattered race and gender barriers. Her unparalleled contributions to aeronautics and human space discovery fundamentally shaped humanity’s quest to explore worlds beyond our own.</p>
      <h3>Queen Elizabeth II (1926-2022)</h3>
      <p>Having reigned for over seven decades, <a href="https://www.discoverwalks.com/blog/london/top-10-remarkable-facts-about-queen-elizabeth-ii-of-england/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Queen Elizabeth II</a> was the longest-serving monarch in British history, showing unmatched devotion and leadership through tremendous societal change. As Queen she has presided over and comforted the UK through times of prosperity and hardship; as head of the Commonwealth, she led fifty-four nations. Steadfast yet evolving, she remained dedicated to civic duty and military service, embracing technology and innovation over time for diplomatic outreach. With sixteen heads of state ushered into office during her rule, she employed vast political experience in constitutional matters to advise Prime Ministers. Her commitment provides stability and continuity bringing pride, admiration, and affection from citizens of the UK and abroad.</p>
      <h3>Rosalind Franklin (1920-1958)</h3>
      <img src="https://www.discoverwalks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rosalind_franklin.jpg" alt="A person is looking through a microscope with focus. They wear a short-sleeved, collared shirt. A lamp is positioned nearby, illuminating the workspace. The image is in black and white, emphasizing the study environment.">
      <p>Rosalind Franklin was a chemist who helped discover the structure of DNA using a method called X-ray diffraction. She took clear photographs showing the DNA’s double helix shape. However, fellow scientists Watson and Crick failed to fully credit her for this evidence that informed their <a href="https://www.discoverwalks.com/blog/world/15-interesting-facts-about-dna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DNA</a> models which earned them the Nobel Prize. Despite not receiving full recognition, Franklin’s meticulous work ethic and dedication to the scientific method were foundational in deciphering life’s genetic code. Even after her early passing, her technical brilliance and pioneering research fundamental to our modern understanding of genetics and lifesaving medical advances like DNA sequencing cemented her legacy as a visionary leader in molecular biology.</p>
      <h3>Betty Friedan (1921-2006)</h3>
      <p>Betty Friedan was a transformative feminist figure who launched the second-wave women’s movement in the 1960s. Her pioneering book, <em>The Feminine Mystique</em>, spoke to millions by daring to confront the unfulfilling, limited suburban domestic lives imposed on women as housewives. Friedan questioned restrictive gender roles and intertwined assumptions hindering female advancement. Becoming a bestselling <a href="https://www.discoverwalks.com/blog/world/50-famous-authors-of-adventure-books-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">author</a> and co-founder of the National Organization for Women, Friedan empowered generations to pursue education, careers, political participation, and personal actualization. She courageously challenged institutional sexism’s deep societal roots and consequences and altered America’s cultural consciousness regarding women’s equality and liberation.</p>
