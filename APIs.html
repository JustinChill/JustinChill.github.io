      <h1 class="article-title">API</h1>
      <h2 class="article-subtitle"></h2>
    </div> 
    <p>Exchanging data is a key function for any software service, and that exchange is usually facilitated using an API. An <b>API</b>, or Application Programming Interface, is a set up instructions that computers use to query (request) information from each other, like requesting a database. This usually happens over the internet.</p>
    <p>One way to think about the role an API plays is to imagine sitting at a restaurant. You review the menu in front of you and, when you're ready, place an order with the waiter. The waiter brings your order to the kitchen and returns with your food. In this example, your order is a <b>request</b>, the waiter is the <b>API</b>, the kitchen is our <b>server</b>, and the <b>response</b> is our food from the kitchen.</p>

    <h2>CRUD</h2>
    <p>CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four most common use cases of an API, and the way you request them is called a <b>method</b>.</p>
    <h3>Get method</h3>
    <p>The most frequently used method used to get data from a server. Say you have an API and you want to get data from it, you call the API with GET. This is a read only method, and you can see it in action right in your browser. This link returns a list of <code>JSON</code> objects: <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/">https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos</a>. This is the R in CRUD.</p> 
    <h3>Post method</h3>
    <p>The POST method is usually used send a request to create a new entry in a your database. This is the C in CRUD. Usually we send the data in a body parameter to a POST method, this way your data won't be exposed inline GET methods query parameters.</p>
    <h3>Put method</h3>
    <p>This works similar to a POST request, but is contextual, PUT method is usually used when you want to update a existing item in your server. This is the U in CRUD.</p>
    <h3>Delete method</h3>
    <p>Used for deleting someting in your database. Pretty self explanatory, this one. NOTE: It is not strictly necessary to use PUT to update and DELETE to delete something from your sever. However, using PUT and DELETE is more readable and semantic way of using methods. This is the D in CRUD.</p>

    <h2>Words you may have heard</h2>
    <h3>Endpoint</h3>
    <p>Endpoints mean the different kinds of urls in your api ends with. They are associated with the GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods of your APIs.</p>

    <h3>Routes</h3>
    <p>These mean the paths of your API endpoint.</p>

    <h3>Query Params</h3>
    <p>The parameters that are appended to your endpoint with a ? in the url. Its a way to send simple data to your api. In this example, <b>sort</b> is the query parameter and it&#39;s <b>value</b> is name:</p>
    <img src="https://public-apis.io/static/5f0f1bf30a256e6a9a53490e072edaf2/ad12c/queryparam.png" alt="endpoint">
    
    <h3>REST</h3>
    <p>Stands for Representational State Transfer. The modern standard for making APIs. Most people confuse this as a technology, but actually this is more of a concept, a standard set of best practices to make APIs.</p>
    
    <h3>URL Encoded</h3>
    <p>Sometimes you need to pass some things in your API query params which could create some issues like spaces, forward slashes etc. You need to encode these special characters so that they can be sent over the internet. You can find a reference of these characters on w3schools.</p>
