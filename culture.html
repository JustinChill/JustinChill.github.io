      <p>Once my manager asked me to take down the photos of smiling team members and their kids from my office walls
        because they weren't "professional", I knew I wouldn't last long. It's alarming how efficiently corporate work
        culture smothers individualism, shreds trust, and pits people against each other. </p>
      <p>Working in a Big Four accounting Firm comes with high expectations. It's the kind of place new graduates aspire
        to work for, a posh, polished multinational. But beneath the professional veneer tensions simmer. Corporate
        micromanagement, with an obsession over minutiae and appearance, has quietly crushed the creativity, spirit, and
        morale of countless employees.</p>
      <!-- The PwC building is <a href="https://www.skyscrapercenter.com/building/pwc-tower-at-park-district/18304">often</a> <a href="https://www.turnerconstruction.com/projects/pwc-headquarters">the</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torre_PwC">tallest</a> in the city. -->
      <p>Taking down the printed memories of a year together as a team felt like tearing down what little morale we had
        left.</p>
      <h3>Uniforms</h3>
      <p>We weren't initially required to wear uniforms to work. At first people dressed up and wore their best. Some of
        the men wore dapper suits, dressing to reflect the pride they took in their work. When we were mandated to wear
        uniforms- garish yellow and black polo shirts- we protested but eventually capitulated. It was an unwelcome
        surprise, but a name tag and uniform didn't seem that unreasonable, even if they were unsightly. </p>
      <p>Leadership's vision was Apple store Genius bar support. Their goal was Best Buy operational efficiency. Reality
        was closer to <mark>metaphor</mark>.</p>
      <p>The real surprise came months later, when it was discovered that the Firm had silently added a ~$200 "gift tax"
        to our paycheck for the privilege of dressing like a Sprint employee. Only after an outcry from the team and a
        flurry of emails did the team eventually get reimbursed.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h3>Time & attendance</h3>
      <p>As a salaried employee, you would expect some flexibility and professional courtesy for maintaining a work
        schedule. Granted if work isn't getting done, or if employees are stealing time, that's a problem. Instead, we
        started to have to "badge-in" at a card reader to start and end our days, to the exact minute. Nothing
        demoralizes a team faster than scrutinizing their time, but the Firm was adamant.</p>
      <p>The first time our team's Director visited our office, it wasn't to engage with the team or provide coaching.
        It was to stakeout the building lobby in an attempt to catch anyone leaving before 5pm. They didn't catch
        anyone, and the team got their first glimpse at management's true priorities.</p>
      <p>Forget autonomy or trust; this felt more like policing middle-schoolers rather than supporting professional
        adults.It was <strong>corporate babysitting</strong>.</p>
      <h3>Expenses</h3>
      <p>When a regular poll revealed low morale amongst the team, management wanted to learn more. They suggested that
        I buy bagels or donuts for the team (18 people) as a special treat. Food is an excellent motivator, and I
        readily agreed. But when I asked for confirmation I should use my corporate Amex, I was told no, we don't have a
        budget at the moment. What I could do instead was Venmo my Director and ask for a refund for my personal
        expense.</p>
      <p>The team had fruit salad instead. I didn't Venmo anyone. But why is there not a clear expense policy or budget
        for a team of 18 people? Surely we can allocate $50 for some bagels.</p>
      <h3>Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs)</h3>
      <p>PIPs are often seen as a last resort for employees who are not meeting expectations. However, at our Firm,
        Performance Improvement Plans were used as a tool to manage and control employees rather than to genuinely help
        them improve.</p>
      <p>Being placed on a PIP was often a precursor to termination, creating an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.
        Instead of fostering a supportive environment for growth, PIPs were used to document shortcomings and justify
        dismissals.</p>
      <h3>Yammer</h3>
      <p>Work Facebook, aka Microsoft's Yammer was hugely popular with senior leadership at work (Fishbowl was hugely
        popular outside). I suspect the "engagement metrics" served by the platform help justify it's use, and any
        social connections formed are a positive secondary effect. Instead of investing in our real, physical people, we
        were encouraged to engage more on Yammer with posts and polls. </p>

      <h3>Vacation hours</h3>
      <p>One silver lining was that vacation hours are accumulated at a Big Four company, as opposed to the "unlimited
        vacation" at most start-ups. That sounds great until you realize you wind up taking less time off and don't get
        paid out for vacation hours when you leave.</p>
      <h3>Communication</h3>
      <p>Communication within the Firm was often top-down and one-way. Senior management would send out memos and emails
        with little to no opportunity for feedback or discussion. This lack of two-way communication made employees feel
        unheard and undervalued. Open forums and town hall meetings were rare, and when they did occur, they were
        tightly controlled to avoid any negative feedback or criticism.</p>
      <h3>Professional Development</h3>
      <p>Professional development opportunities were limited and often reserved for a select few. While the Firm touted
        its commitment to employee growth, the reality was that only those who were already high performers or had
        strong connections within the company were given access to training and development programs. This created a
        sense of favoritism and inequality, further eroding morale and trust.</p>
      <h3>Work-Life Balance</h3>
      <p>Work-life balance was virtually non-existent. The expectation was that employees would be available and
        responsive at all times, including evenings, weekends, and even during vacations. This constant demand for
        availability led to burnout and high turnover rates. The Firm's lack of respect for personal time and boundaries
        made it difficult for employees to maintain a healthy work-life balance.</p>
      <h3>Recognition and Rewards</h3>
      <p>Recognition and rewards were few and far between. While the Firm had formal recognition programs, they were
        often seen as superficial and insincere. Genuine appreciation and acknowledgment of hard work were rare, and
        when they did occur, they were usually tied to specific metrics or achievements rather than overall
        contributions. This lack of meaningful recognition made employees feel undervalued and unappreciated.</p>
      <h3>Diversity and Inclusion</h3>
      <p>Despite the Firm's public commitment to diversity and inclusion, the reality was quite different. There was a
        lack of representation at the senior leadership level, and efforts to promote diversity and inclusion were often
        seen as tokenistic. Employees from underrepresented groups felt marginalized and unsupported, further
        contributing to a toxic work environment.</p>
      <h3>Health and Wellness</h3>
      <p>Health and wellness initiatives were minimal and often overlooked. While the Firm offered basic health
        benefits, there was little emphasis on mental health and well-being. The high-stress environment took a toll on
        employees' mental and physical health, and there were few resources available to support them. This lack of
        focus on health and wellness further contributed to burnout and high turnover rates.</p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>In conclusion, working at a Big Four accounting Firm comes with a host of challenges that go beyond the high
        expectations and professional veneer. The corporate culture often smothers individualism, erodes trust, and pits
        people against each other. From micromanagement and uniforms to time and attendance policies, expenses, and
        performance improvement plans, the Firm's practices often demoralize and disempower employees. While there are
        some silver linings, such as accumulated vacation hours, the overall experience can be detrimental to employees'
        well-being and job satisfaction.</p>
