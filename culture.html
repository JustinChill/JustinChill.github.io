      <p>Once my manager recommended I take down the photos of smiling team members and their families from my office walls because they weren't "professional", I knew I wouldn't last long. Taking down the printed memories of a year together as a team felt like tearing down what little morale we had left.</p>
      <p>Working in a Big Four accounting Firm comes with high expectations. It's the kind of place aspirational graduates aspire to work for, a posh, polished multinational. But beneath the corporate veneer tensions simmer. Corporate micromanagement, with an obsession over minutiae and appearance, has quietly hollowed out the creativity, spirit, and morale of countless employees.</p>
      <h3>Uniforms</h3>
      <p>We weren't initially required to wear uniforms to work. At first people dressed up and wore their best. Some of the men wore dapper suits, dressed to reflect the pride they took in their work. When we were mandated to wear uniforms- garish yellow and black polo shirts- we protested but eventually capitulated.A name tag and uniform didn't seem that unreasonable, even if they were unsightly. </p>
      <p>The real surprise came months later, when it was discovered that the Firm had silently added a ~$200 "gift tax" for the privilege of dressing like a Sprint employee. Only after an outcry from the team and a flurry of emails did the team eventually get reimbursed.</p> 
      <h3>Time & attendance</h3>
      <p>As a salaried employee, you would expect some flexibility and professional courtesy for maintaining a work schedule. If that work isn't getting done, or if employees are stealing time, that's a problem. Instead, we started to have to "badge-in" at a card reader to start and end our days, to the exact minute. Nothing demoralizes a team faster than scrutinizing their time, but the Firm was adamant.</p>
      <p>The first time our team's Director visited our office, it wasn't to engage with the team or provide coaching. It was to stakeout the building lobby in an attempt to catch anyone leaving before 5pm. They didn't catch anyone, and the team got their first glimpse at management's true priorities.</p>
      <p>Forget autonomy or trust; this felt more like policing middle-schoolers rather than supporting professional adults.It was <strong>corporate babysitting</strong>.</p>
      <h3>Expenses</h3>
      <p>When a regular poll revealed low morale amongst the team, management wanted to learn more. They suggested that I buy bagels or donuts for the team (18 people) as a special treat. Food is an excellent motivator, and I readily agreed. But when I asked for confirmation I should use my corporate Amex, I was told no, we don't have a budget at the moment. What I could do instead was Venmo my Director and ask for a refund for my personal expense.</p>
      <p>The team had fruit salad instead. I didn't Venmo anyone. But why is there not a clear expense policy or budget for a team of 18 people? Surely we can allocate $50 for some bagels.</p>
      <h3>Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs)</h3>
      <p></p>
      <h3>Yammer</h3>
      <p>Work Facebook, aka Microsoft's Yammer was hugely popular with senior leadership at work (Fishbowl was hugely popular outside). I suspect the "engagement metrics" served by the platform help justify it's use, and social connections are a positive secondary effect. Instead of investing in our real, physical people, we were encouraged to engage more on Yammer with posts and polls. </p>
      <h3>Vacation hours</h3>
      <p>One silver lining was that vacation hours are accumulated at a Big Four company, as opposed to the "unlimited vacation" at most start-ups. That sounds great until you realize you wind up taking less time off and don't get paid out for vacation hours when you leave.</p>
