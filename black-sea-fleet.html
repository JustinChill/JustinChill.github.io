    <p>When Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it set off the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II<a href="#RAND" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="RAND-ref"></a>. At the start of the war Russia had more than 70 ships, and boasted that their navy was “invincible”. Ukraine however has shown surprising naval capability in the <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2022/02/25/what-makes-the-black-sea-so-strategically-important/">Black Sea</a>, helping to protect its shores and shipping lanes while keeping the Russian navy at bay. This is remarkable because Ukraine has <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2021/08/09/after-2014-decimation-ukrainian-navy-rebuilds-to-fend-off-russia/">virtually no warships</a>. It has succeeded through the skillful use of <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/2023/09/11/ukraine-is-ushering-in-a-new-uncrewed-era-at-sea/">emerging technologies</a>, such as explosive-laden <a href="/pubs/commentary/2022/11/the-age-of-uncrewed-surface-vessels.html">uncrewed surface vessels</a>, and older methods, such as land-based missiles (Harpoon and Neptune especially) and naval mines.</p>

    <h3>Timeline</h3>

    <p>Feb 24, 2022: Invasion begins.</p>
    <p>Feb 24. Russian Navy captures the strategic Snake Island. The SLAVA Class cruiser Moskva plays a prominent role. Reputedly, the Ukrainian garrison on the island replies to suggestions of surrender with “Russian Warship, go fuck yourself”.</p>
    <img src="imgs/1614px-Rally_in_support_of_Ukraine_in_Columbus,_Ohio,_United_States,_26_February_2022_(51906586684)_-_edited.jpg" loading="lazy">
    <p>Before March 3: Majority of Ukrainian Navy warships are captured, sunk or scuttled at the onset of the invasion. Notably, the scuttled vessels include the frigate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_frigate_Hetman_Sahaidachny">Hetman Sahaidachny</a>. Ukraine, whose fleet was massively out-gunned, is left with only a few smaller vessels.</p>
    <p>Feb-Mar: Russian Navy warships bombard Ukrainian coastline off Odesa.</p>
    <p>Mar 7: Reports that Ukraine hit and sunk a Russian patrol ship, Vasily Bykov, with rocket fire off Odesa. These reports subsequently shown to be incorrect, the first of several ‘<em>wishful sinkings</em>’.</p>
    <p>Mid-Mar: Russia starts removing the hull numbers from its warships in the Black Sea to frustrate attempts to gather intelligence on movements.</p>
    <p>March: Subsequent reports that the Russian frigate Admiral Essen was hit by a Neptune missile off Odesa. There were several 'wishful sinkings' at the time, however indications are that this occurred. Missile did not hit cleanly, limited damage.</p>
    <p>Mar 22: Russian Raptor class assault boat hit by Ukrainian anti-tank missile near Mariupol.</p>
    <p>Mar 24: Russian Navy Alligator class landing ship Saratov hit while unloading at Berdyansk on Sea of Azov. Possibly hit by a Ukrainian ballistic missile. The ship explodes, damaging two Ropucha class landing ships which manage to escape. The ship sinks at the quay. Russia stops using the port for reinforcements.</p>
    <p>Apr 7: Reported in Naval News that <a href="https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2022/04/russias-most-powerful-warship-in-the-black-sea-is-operating-in-a-pattern/" target="blank">SLAVA class cruiser Moskva is operating predictably</a>. Precursor of things to come.</p>
    <p>Apr 13. The SLAVA class cruiser Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet and most powerful warship in the area, is hit by two Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles. It sinks the next day.</p>
    <img src="http://www.hisutton.com/images/Russia-Navy-Moskva-Damage.jpg" loading="lazy">

    <h4>Post Moskva Sinking</h4>
    <p>May: Fighting intensifies around Snake Island. Ukrainian TB2 drones play a major role, hitting two Raptor assault boats and sinking a landing craft at the jetty. Russian attempts to reinforce and supply it begin to appear more precarious. On at least one occasion Ukraine deploys a BM-27 Uragan MLRS on a barge to bombard the island.</p>
    <img src="https://www.navalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Ukraine-Bayraktar-TB2-Drone-Ghost-Of-Snake-Island.jpg" loading="lazy">
    <p>Late May: Harpoon and Brimstone missiles supplied to Ukraine. These threaten Russian Navy warships.</p>
    <p>Late May: Smaller Russian warships, including gunboats, involved in capture of Mariupol. </p>
    <p>Jun 10: Ukrainian Navy landing ship Yuri Olefirenko attacked by Russian rockets near Ochakiv. The ship, the largest remaining in the Ukrainian Navy, survives.</p>
    <p>Jun 17: Russian ship Vasiliy Bekh, carrying a SA-15 GAUNTLET (Tor) air-defense missile system, is sunk by Harpoon or Neptune missiles.</p>
    <p>Jun 20: Ukraine attacks Russian controlled gas platforms in mid-Black Sea with Harpoon or Neptune missiles (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-hits-oil-crimean-drilling-platforms-pro-russian-regional-head-says-2022-06-20/">Reuters</a>).</p>
    <p>Jun 29: Two target barges, normally resident in the Russian naval base at Novorossiysk, were towed to Kerch. They are positioned as decoys to protect the bridge from attack.</p>
    <p>Jun 30: Russia abandons Snake Island.</p>
    <p>Jul: Threatened by Harpoon and Neptune, Russian ships largely withdraw from western side of northern Black Sea. This is a significant change in the balance of the war.</p>
    <p>Jul 7: Ukrainian forces briefly land on Snake Island. Special Forces from 73rd Naval Special Purpose Center used underwater vehicles in this mission.</p>
    <p>Jul 27: Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI) signed, effectively breaking the blockage of Odesa. (<a href="https://www.un.org/en/black-sea-grain-initiative">United Nations</a>).</p>

    <p>Aug 24: SLAVA Class cruiser Marshall Ustinov leaves Mediterranean, to return to Northern Fleet home. This leaves the Russian Navy weaker in the Mediterranean. </p>
    <p>Early Sep: Russian nuclear powered submarine, likely Severodvinsk, reported in Mediterranean. Seen as part of the outer defense for the Black Sea operations. </p>
    <p>Sep 8: Romanian Navy Musca-class minesweeper, <em>Lieutenant Dimitrie Nicolescu (29)</em>, damaged by a floating mine off Romanian coast. Romanian forces have neutralized several floating mines believed to have broken free from their moorings further north. Attribution unclear.</p>
    <p>Sep 21. Ukrainian explosive Uncrewed surface vessel (USV) washes up on beach outside Sevastopol. These are popularly called 'maritime drones'. Russian forces destroy it but otherwise do not appear to react to new threat.</p>
    <p>Sep 26: Nord Stream 1 &amp; 2 pipelines sabotaged in Baltic. Attribution subject to debate.</p>
    <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fe3.365dm.com%2F22%2F09%2F2048x1152%2Fskynews-gas-bubbles-nord-stream-2_5912415.jpg%3F20220928155216&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=b8aa8141d5f7e35c1a26213f48f2158e55c8e7665236e0030d591dfb8e0d4990&ipo=images" loading="lazy">
    <p>October 29. Major combined Ukrainian maritime drone (USV) and UAV attack on Sevastopol. Several USVs penetrate the harbour and two warships, the minesweeper Ivan Golubets and frigate Admiral Makarov, are hit. Neither ship is sunk. However Russia withdraws fleet into bases and starts initiating increased defenses.</p>
    <img src="http://www.hisutton.com/images/Russia-Ukraine-Maritime-Drones-attack.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Artist's impression of maritime drones attacking Sevastopol. H I Sutton.">
    <p>Oct 8: Ukraine attacks Kerch Bridge. Both roadway and railway connections broken. Repairs take months and in meantime Russian Navy landing ships increasingly used as transports.</p>

    <p>Early Feb: Space X, and its founder Elon Musk, say that they will stop Ukraine using their StarLink satellite communications system for long range drones. This may have prevented Ukraine using its explosive USVs near Crimea until an alternative can be found. Russian Navy increases activity of Crimea.  </p>
    <p>Feb 10: Russia deploys its own explosive USVs, with one targeting the bridge at Zatoka, south of Odesa.</p>
    <img alt="Russian maritime drone attacks bridge at Zatoka" src="http://www.hisutton.com/images/Russia-maritime-drone-attacks-Zatoka.jpg" loading="lazy">
    <p>Feb 28: Ukrainian UAV attack on oil facilities at port of Tuapse, north of Sochi. This is notable for its distance from Ukrainian controlled territory and strategic relevance. Russia deploys air defenses there, observed Mar 6.</p>

    <h4>2024</h4>

    <p>Ukraine has repeatedly employed explosive-laden USVs to target ships, even in Russian ports hundreds of miles from Ukrainian-controlled waters. Ukraine also likely used them to damage the Kerch Strait Bridge, a vital logistical link between southern Russia and occupied Crimea. Ukraine is now <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/09/29/ukraine-has-a-drone-submarine-russia-isnt-ready-for-it/?sh=27425df16049">developing</a> an explosive-laden uncrewed undersea vehicle, which can achieve greater stealth than a USV.</p>
