      <p>No tech mogul escapes unscathed in <em>Burn Book</em>, Kara Swisher's paean to Silicon Valley revolutionaries. Swisher, a veteran chronicler of Big Tech, is both an insider and an outsider, having reported on tech's most prominent figures for so long she is regarded as both Silicon Valley’s “<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2014/07/kara-swisher-silicon-valleys-most-powerful-snoop.html">most feared” and “well-liked</a>” journalist. She has attended baby showers for tech billionaires’ kids and even had an impromptu sleepover with Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin at her mother’s apartment in New York City once, due to an elevator malfunction. She is explicit, though, that the people she covers are not her friends. She has a profound distaste for the Valley’s “<em>look-at-me narcissists, who never met an idea that they did not try to take credit for</em>”.</p>
      <p>The original “Burn Book” from <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377092/">Mean Girls</a></em> was used to spread rumors and gossip about other girls (and some boys) at North Shore High School. Swisher’s version tells true stories about the men (they're nearly all men, she wryly notes) who dominate Silicon Valley. There are a few cringey moments, but mostly she traces how the idiosyncrasies, blind spots, and enthusiasms of the tech leaders she reported on have come to shape and dominate our world.</p>
      <p>As she recounts interviews with everyone from Steve Jobs to Andrew Yang, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk, Kara reveals a disturbing pattern of most founders devolving from idealistic strivers to morally compromised, insulated rich people. This is important to care about because these are extraordinarily powerful individuals who wield massive global influence, even controlling activities in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/08/world/europe/elon-musk-starlink-ukraine.html">space and active war zones</a>.</p>
      <p>When she is angry, Swisher does not hold back, and you can really feel her younger self’s frustration and rage at the ossified power structure and the straight white men who still dominated: “I hated their entitlement and certainty that the future belonged to them.”</p>
      <p>By 2016, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/trump-tech-summit.html" title="">when Tech’s leading figures go to Trump Tower for a photo op</a> with a man who seems to her the opposite of everything they once stood for, Swisher is disappointed but unsurprised by their “casual hypocrisy.” By 2020, she writes, she has become “less of a chronicler of the internet age and more of its cranky Cassandra,” warning of Tech’s increasingly unaccountable power.</p>
      <p>Her forthrightness goes some way in helping us believe that “Burn Book” doesn’t merely represent a convenient pivot, as they say, from Tech royalty to Tech heretic at a time when strident industry criticism is trending hard. But “Burn Book”’s fatal flaw, the reason it can never fully dispel the whiff of opportunism that dooms any memoir, is that Swisher never shows in any convincing detail how her entanglement with Silicon Valley clouded her judgment. The story of her change of heart is thus undercut by the self-aggrandizing portrait that rests stubbornly at its core. “At least now we know the problems,” Swisher writes of Silicon Valley at the end of “Burn Book.” Do we?</p>

      <q>There is no question that kind of wealth does inevitably warp tech titans as they navigate their frictionless world that allows them to go from private plane to armored car to a home office on an island.</q>
