      <p>No tech mogul escapes unscathed in <em>Burn Book</em>, Kara Swisher's paean to Silicon Valley revolutionaries. Swisher, a veteran chronicler of Big Tech, is both an insider and an outsider, having reported on tech's most prominent figures for so long she is regarded as both Silicon Valley’s “<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2014/07/kara-swisher-silicon-valleys-most-powerful-snoop.html">most feared” and “well-liked</a>” journalist. She has attended baby showers for tech billionaires’ kids and even had an impromptu sleepover with Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin at her mother’s apartment in New York City, due to an elevator malfunction. She is explicit, though, that the people she covers are not her friends. She has a profound distaste for the Valley’s “<em>look-at-me narcissists, who never met an idea that they did not try to take credit for</em>”.</p>
      <p>The original “Burn Book” from <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377092/">Mean Girls</a></em> was used to spread rumors and gossip about other girls (and some boys) at North Shore High School. Swisher’s version tells true stories about the men (they're nearly all men, she wryly notes) who dominate Silicon Valley. She does dish about a few cringey moments, but mostly the book traces how the idiosyncrasies, blind spots, and enthusiasms of the tech leaders she covered have come to shape and dominate our world.</p>
      <p>As she recounts interviews with everyone from Steve Jobs to Andrew Yang, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk, Kara reveals a disturbing pattern of most founders devolving from idealistic strivers to morally compromised, insulated rich people. This is important to care about because these are extraordinarily powerful individuals who wield massive global influence, even controlling activities in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/08/world/europe/elon-musk-starlink-ukraine.html">space and active war zones</a>.</p>

        <p>Over time, she went from merely <em>asking</em> these tech leaders what they were thinking and doing to <em>telling</em> them what <em>she </em>thought of their business deals and their products. And she says many wanted to hear her opinions.</p>

        <p>By 2016, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/trump-tech-summit.html" title="">when Tech’s leading figures go to Trump Tower for a photo op</a> with a man who seems to her the opposite of everything they once stood for, Swisher is disappointed but unsurprised by their “casual hypocrisy.” By 2020, she writes, she has become “less of a chronicler of the internet age and more of its cranky Cassandra,” warning of Tech’s increasingly unaccountable power.</p>

      <q>There is no question that kind of wealth does inevitably warp tech titans as they navigate their frictionless world that allows them to go from private plane to armored car to a home office on an island.</q>
