      <p>I remember when Donald Trump was not who we are.</p>
      <p>I remember when Trump was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oT_4RJx4G0" target="_blank">running as a joke</a>.</p>
      <p>I remember when Trump was best <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-note-about-our-coverage-of-donald-trumps-campaign_n_55a8fc9ce4b0896514d0fd66" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">covered in the entertainment section.</a></p>
      <p>I remember when Trump would never become the Republican nominee.</p>
      <p>I remember when Trump couldn’t win the general election.</p>
      <p>I remember when Trump’s <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/sep/04/donald-trump/yes-donald-trump-did-call-john-mccain-loser/">attacks</a> on John McCain were disqualifying.</p>
      <p>I remember when Trump’s “grab women by the pussies” brag on <a href="<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html">Access Hollywood</a> would force him out.</p>
      <p>I remember when Trump was James Comey’s fault.</p>
      <p>I remember when Trump was the news media’s fault.</p>
      <p>I remember when Trump won because Hillary Clinton was unlikable.</p>
      <p>I remember when 2016 was a fluke and a racist reaction to Obama's presidency.</p>
      <p>I remember when the office of the presidency would temper Trump.</p>
      <p>I remember when the adults in the room would contain him.</p>
      <p>I remember when the Ukraine phone call went too far.</p>
      <p>I remember when Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/02/05/susan-collins-trump-learned-lesson-state-of-the-union-sot-nd-vpx.cnn" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">learned his lesson</a> after the first impeachment.</p>
      <p>I remember when Jan. 6 would be the end of Trump’s political career.</p>
      <img src="https://liberalarts.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Capitol-1024x768.jpg" />
      <p>I remember when the 2022 midterms and the "Blue wave" meant the country was moving on.</p>
      <p>I remember when Trump’s indictments (34!) would give voters pause.</p>
      <p>I remember when Trump’s felony convictions would give voters pause.</p>
      <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fint.nyt.com%2Fdata%2Fdocumenttools%2F2eff09dcd27ae2e3%2F1%2Foutput-1.png&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=55b1be7e400c5f810e187013696a919b1245ab607d42ee8ba269c6bed2321c22&ipo=images" />
      <p>I remember when Trump would win because Joe Biden was old.</p>
      <p>I remember when Kamala Harris’s joy would overpower Trump’s fearmongering.</p>
      <p>I remember when Trump was weird.</p>
      <p>I remember when calling Puerto Rico a "floating island of garbage" would cost Trump the election.</p>
      <p>I remember when Trump was not who we are.</p>
      <p>And yet, this election Mr. Trump’s victory was even more resounding than 2016. For the first time in his three campaigns for president, he won the popular vote. He won all seven swing states, giving him a greater margin in the electoral college than in 2016. <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/graphic-detail/2024/11/07/five-charts-show-how-trump-won-the-election">All 50 states shifted rightward</a>. He dominated this election despite being impeached twice, defeated in the election of 2020, prosecuted four times, convicted of multiple felonies and found liable for sexual abuse. It is arguably the most remarkable political comeback in American history.</p>
