      <p>The universe is filled with billions of star systems. Located inside galaxies, these cosmic arrangements are made up of at least one star and all the objects that travel around it, including planets, dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. The star system we’re most familiar with, of course, is our own.</p>
      <p>Our solar system consists of the Sun and many smaller objects: the planets, their moons and rings, and miscellaneous “debris” like asteroids, comets, and dust. Centuries of observation and decades of spacecraft exploration have revealed that most of these objects formed together with the Sun about 4.5 billion years ago. They represent clumps of material that condensed from an enormous cloud of gas and dust. The central part of this cloud became our Sun, and a small fraction of the material in the outer parts eventually formed the other objects.</p>
      <p>Our understanding of our place in the cosmos is constantly evolving. In addition to gathering information with powerful new telescopes, humans have sent spacecraft directly to many members of the planetary system. With evocative names such as Voyager, Pioneer, <em>Curiosity</em>, and Pathfinder, our robot explorers have flown past, orbited, or landed on every planet, returning images and data that have dazzled both astronomers and the public. In the process, we have also investigated two dwarf planets, hundreds of fascinating moons, four ring systems, a dozen asteroids, and several comets.</p>
      <aside>A <strong>comet</strong> is a small body of icy and dusty matter that revolves about the Sun; when a comet comes near the Sun, some of its material vaporizes, forming a large head of tenuous gas and often a tail.</aside>
      <p>Our probes have penetrated the atmosphere of Jupiter and landed on the surfaces of Venus, Mars, our Moon, Saturn’s moon Titan, the asteroids Eros and Itokawa, and the Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko (usually referred to as 67P). Humans have set foot on the Moon and returned samples of its surface soil for laboratory analysis. We have even discovered other places in our solar system that might be able to support some kind of life.</p>

      <h2>The Sun</h2>
      <p>At the center of our solar system is a star called the <a class="reflink" href="/kids/article/Sun/353824">Sun</a>. The Sun, a star that is brighter than about 80% of the stars in the Galaxy, is by far the most massive member of the solar system, as shown in the table below. It is an enormous ball about 1.4 million kilometers in diameter, with surface layers of incandescent gas and an interior temperature of millions of degrees. In addition, the Sun contains more than 99 percent of all the material in the solar system.</p>
      <p>It has a temperature, at its core, of more than 28,080,000° F (15,600,000° C). It constantly changes the hydrogen in its core into helium. This process gives out huge amounts of radiation, or energy. Living things on Earth depend on this energy, in the form of light and heat.</p>
      <table summary="This table has 2 columns and 8 rows. The first row is a header row and labels each column, “Object” and “Percentage of Total Mass of Solar System”. Under the “Object” column are the values, “Sun”, “Jupiter”, “Comets”, “All other planets and dwarf planets”, “Moons and rings”, “Asteroids”, and “Cosmic dust”.

      <p>This table also shows that most of the material of the planets is actually concentrated in the largest one, Jupiter, which is more massive than all the rest of the planets combined. Astronomers were able to determine the masses of the planets centuries ago using Kepler’s laws of planetary motion and Newton’s law of gravity to measure the planets’ gravitational effects on one another or on moons that orbit them (see <a href="https://pressbooks.online.ucf.edu/astronomybc/chapter/3-4-orbits-in-the-solar-system/">Orbits and Gravity</a>). Today, we make even more precise measurements of their masses by tracking their gravitational effects on the motion of spacecraft that pass near them.</p>
      <p>Beside Earth, five other planets were known to the ancients—Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn—and two were discovered after the invention of the telescope: Uranus and Neptune. The eight planets all revolve in the same direction around the Sun. They orbit in approximately the same plane, like cars traveling on concentric tracks on a giant, flat racecourse. Each planet stays in its own “traffic lane,” following a nearly circular orbit about the Sun and obeying the “traffic” laws discovered by Galileo, Kepler, and Newton. Besides these planets, we have also been discovering smaller worlds beyond Neptune that are called trans-Neptunian objects or <strong>TNOs</strong>. The first to be found, in 1930, was Pluto, but others have been discovered during the twenty-first century. One of them, Eris, is about the same size as Pluto and has at least one moon (Pluto has five known moons). The largest <abbr title="trans-Neptunian objects">TNOs</abbr> are also classed as <em>dwarf planets,</em> as is the largest asteroid, Ceres. To date, more than 1,750 of these <abbr title="trans-Neptunian objects">TNOs</abbr> have been discovered.</p>
      <h3>Orbits of the Planets</h3>

The orbits of each object is shown as a blue ellipse. All eight major planets and the asteroids orbit the Sun in roughly the same plane, but the orbits of the outer dwarf planets do not. The objects plotted in the diagram moving outward from the Sun are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Ceres, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris." loading="lazy">
      <figcaption>All eight major planets orbit the Sun in roughly the same plane. The five currently known dwarf planets are also shown: Eris, Haumea, Pluto, Ceres, and Makemake. Note that Pluto’s orbit is not in the plane of the planets.</figcaption>
      <p>Each of the planets and dwarf planets also rotates (spins) about an axis running through it, and in most cases the direction of rotation is the same as the direction of revolution about the Sun. The exceptions are Venus, which rotates backward very slowly (that is, in a retrograde direction), and Uranus and Pluto, which also have strange rotations, each spinning about an axis tipped nearly on its side. We do not yet know the spin orientations of Eris, Haumea, and Makemake.</p>
      <p>The four planets closest to the Sun (Mercury through Mars) are called the inner or terrestrial planets. Often, the Moon is also included as a part of this group, bringing the total of terrestrial objects to five. The terrestrial planets are relatively small worlds, composed primarily of rock and metal. All of them have solid surfaces that bear the records of their geological history in the forms of craters, mountains, and volcanoes.</p>
      <aside>We generally call Earth’s satellite “the Moon,” with a capital M, and the other satellites “moons,” with lowercase m’s.</aside>

      <p>Mercury is the nearest planet to the Sun, and, in accordance with Kepler’s third law, it has the shortest period of revolution about the Sun (88 of our days) and the highest average orbital speed (48 kilometers per second). It is appropriately named for the fleet-footed messenger god of the Romans. Because Mercury remains close to the Sun, it can be difficult to pick out in the sky. As you might expect, it’s best seen when its eccentric orbit takes it as far away from the Sun as possible.</p>
      <p>The semimajor axis of Mercury’s orbit—that is, the planet’s average distance from the Sun—is 58 million kilometers, or 0.39 AU. However, because its orbit has the high eccentricity of 0.206, Mercury’s actual distance from the Sun varies from 46 million kilometers at perihelion to 70 million kilometers at aphelion.</p>
      <aside><strong>Aphelion</strong> is the point in the orbit of a planet, comet, or other celestial body where it is farthest from the Sun.</aside>
      <p>Mercury, being close to the Sun, is very hot on its daylight side; but because it has no appreciable atmosphere, it gets surprisingly cold during the long nights. The temperature on the surface climbs to 700 K (430 °C) at noontime. After sunset, however, the temperature drops, reaching 100 K (–170 °C) just before dawn. (It is even colder in craters near the poles that receive no sunlight at all.) The range in temperature on Mercury is thus 600 K (or 600 °C), a greater difference than on any other planet.</p>

      <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is known for its thick, toxic atmosphere and extreme surface temperatures. It's often called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size and composition.</p>
      <p>Venus appears very bright, and even a small telescope reveals that it goes through phases like the Moon. Galileo discovered that Venus displays a full range of phases, and he used this as an argument to show that Venus must circle the Sun and not Earth. The planet’s actual surface is not visible because it is shrouded by dense clouds that reflect about 70% of the sunlight that falls on them, frustrating efforts to study the underlying surface, even with cameras in orbit around the planet.</p>
      <p>Most of our information on the geology of Venus is derived from the US <em>Magellan</em> spacecraft, which mapped Venus with a powerful <em>imaging radar</em>. <em>Magellan</em> produced images with a resolution of 100 meters, much better than that of previous missions, yielding our first detailed look at the surface of our sister planet. The <em>Magellan</em> spacecraft returned returned 1,200 gigabits of data, far exceeding the 900 gigabits of data from all NASA planetary missions combined at the time<a href="#Magellan" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="Magellan-ref"></a>. Each 100 minutes of data transmission from the spacecraft provided enough information, if translated into characters, to fill two 30-volume encyclopedias!</p>

      <p>Earth is a medium-size planet with a diameter of ~12,760 kilometers. As one of the inner or terrestrial planets, it is composed primarily of heavy elements such as iron, silicon, and oxygen—very different from the composition of the Sun and stars, which are dominated by the light elements hydrogen and helium. Earth’s orbit is nearly circular, and Earth is warm enough to support liquid water on its surface. It is the only planet in our solar system that is neither too hot nor too cold, but “just right” for the development of life as we know it.</p>

      <h3>Earth's Interior</h3>
      <p>The interior of a planet—even our own Earth—is difficult to study, and its composition and structure must be determined indirectly. Our only direct experience is with the outermost skin of Earth<sup>’</sup>s crust, a layer no more than a few kilometers deep. It is important to remember that, in many ways, we know less about our own planet 5 kilometers beneath our feet than we do about the surfaces of Venus and Mars.</p>
      <p>Earth is composed largely of metal and silicate rock (see: the <a class="target-chapter" href="https://pressbooks.online.ucf.edu/astronomybc/chapter/7-2-composition-and-structure-of-planets/">Composition and Structure of Planets</a>). Most of this material is in a solid state, but some of it is hot enough to be molten. The structure of material in Earth’s interior has been probed in considerable detail by measuring the transmission of seismic waves through Earth. These are waves that spread through the interior of Earth from earthquakes or explosion sites.</p>
      <h3>Magnetic Field and Magnetosphere</h3>
      <p>Our planet behaves in some ways as if a giant bar magnet were inside it, aligned approximately with the rotational poles of Earth. This magnetic field is generated by moving material in Earth’s liquid metallic core. As the liquid metal inside Earth circulates, it sets up a circulating electric current. When many charged particles are moving together like that—in the laboratory or on the scale of an entire planet—they produce a magnetic field.</p>
      <p>Earth’s magnetic field extends into surrounding space. When a charged particle encounters a magnetic field in space, it becomes trapped in the magnetic zone. Above Earth’s atmosphere, our field is able to trap small quantities of electrons and other atomic particles. This region, called the magnetosphere, is defined as the zone within which Earth’s magnetic field dominates over the weak interplanetary magnetic field that extends outward from the Sun.</p>
      <figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://pressbooks.online.ucf.edu/app/uploads/sites/40/2018/12/OSC_Astro_08_01_Magnetosph-1.jpg" alt="Illustration of the Earth’s Magnetosphere. At left an arrow points leftward indicating the direction of the Sun. The Solar wind is drawn as numerous particles coming from the left. Slightly off-center to the right the Earth is shown, with an arrow for the north pole pointing upward, and one pointing down for the south pole. To the left and right of the Earth are two nested purple crescents with their points touching the poles of the Earth. These areas are labeled as the Van Allen belts. Outside the Van Allen belts the lines of the magnetic field are drawn in white. On the left side of the Earth (facing the Sun in this diagram), the lines originate at the north pole and curve out away from the surface then curve back to end at the south pole. Four of these curves are shown, each extending further out into space than the one proceeding it. On the right side of the Earth (facing away from the Sun), the magnetic field lines are also drawn, but have very different shapes than those on the left. The innermost line on the right looks very similar to the innermost line of the left. But each successive line moves further and further out into space before returning to the poles. Thus the magnetic field is much more elongated in shape on the side of the Earth facing away from the Sun.">

      <p>Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance. It has the largest volcano and canyon in the solar system.</p>
      <p>Mars has been intensively investigated by spacecraft. More than 50 spacecraft have been launched toward Mars, but only about half were fully successful. The first visitor was the US Mariner 4, which flew past Mars in 1965 and transmitted 22 photos to Earth. These pictures showed an apparently bleak planet with abundant impact craters. Newspaper headlines sadly announced that Mars was a “dead planet.”</p>
      <p>In 1971, NASA’s Mariner 9 became the first spacecraft to orbit another planet, mapping the entire surface of Mars at a resolution of about 1 kilometer and discovering a great variety of geological features, including volcanoes, huge canyons, intricate layers on the polar caps, and channels that appeared to have been cut by running water. Geologically, Mars didn’t look so dead after all.</p>

      <p>The next four planets (Jupiter through Neptune) are much larger and are composed primarily of lighter ices, liquids, and gases. We call these four the jovian planets (after “Jove,” another name for Jupiter in mythology) or giant planets—a name they rightfully deserve.

      <p>The giant planets are very far from the Sun. Jupiter is more than five times farther from the Sun than Earth’s distance (5 AU), and takes just under 12 years to circle the Sun. Saturn is about twice as far away as Jupiter (almost 10 AU) and takes nearly 30 years to complete one orbit. Uranus orbits at 19 AU with a period of 84 years, while Neptune, at 30 AU, requires 165 years for each circuit of the Sun. These long timescales make it difficult for us short-lived humans to study seasonal change on the outer planets.</p>
      <p>Jupiter, the giant among giants, has enough mass to make 318 Earths. Its diameter is about 11 times that of Earth (and about one tenth that of the Sun). Jupiter’s average density is 1.3 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, much lower than that of any of the terrestrial planets. (Water has a density of 1 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.) Jupiter’s material is spread out over a volume so large that more than 1,400 Earths could fit within it.</p>
      <p>Seen through a telescope, Jupiter is a colorful and dynamic planet. Distinct details in its cloud patterns allow us to determine the rotation rate of its atmosphere at the cloud level, although such atmosphere rotation may have little to do with the spin of the underlying planet. The vibrant colors of the clouds on Jupiter present a puzzle to astronomers: given the cool temperatures and the composition of nearly 90% hydrogen, the atmosphere should be colorless. One hypothesis suggests that perhaps colorful hydrogen compounds rise from warm areas.</p>

      <p>Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is famous for its extensive ring system. It's the second-largest planet in the solar system.</p>
      <p>The visible atmosphere of Saturn is composed of approximately 75% hydrogen and 25% helium, with trace amounts of methane, ethane, propane, and other hydrocarbons. The overall structure is similar to that of Jupiter. Temperatures are somewhat colder, however, and the atmosphere is more extended due to Saturn’s lower surface gravity. Thus, the layers are stretched out over a longer distance.</p>
      <p>Saturn has one anomalous cloud structure that has mystified scientists: a hexagonal wave pattern around the north pole. The six sides of the hexagon are each longer than the diameter of Earth. Winds are also extremely high on Saturn, with speeds of up to 1,800 kilometers per hour measured near the equator.</p>
      <p>The image below shows Saturn and its complex system of rings, taken from a distance of about 1.2 million kilometers. This natural-color image is a composite of 36 images taken over the course of 2.5 hours by Cassini.</p>

      <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and has a unique blue-green color due to methane in its atmosphere. It rotates on its side, making it unique among the planets.</p>
      <p>We don’t know what caused Uranus to be tipped over like this, but one possibility is a collision with a large planetary body when our system was first forming. Whatever the cause, this unusual tilt creates dramatic seasons.</p>
      <p id="fs-id1168468610698">Unlike Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus is almost entirely featureless as seen at wavelengths that range from the ultraviolet to the infrared (see its rather boring image <a class="autogenerated-content" href="https://pressbooks.online.ucf.edu/astronomybc/chapter/11-0-thinking-ahead/#OSC_Astro_11_00_GiantPlan">here</a>). Calculations indicate that the basic atmospheric structure of Uranus should resemble that of Jupiter and Saturn, although its upper clouds are composed of methane rather than ammonia. However, the absence of an internal heat source suppresses up-and-down movement and leads to a very stable atmosphere with little visible structure.</p>

      <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in our solar system. It's known for its deep blue color and strong winds, some of the fastest in the solar system.</p>
      <p>Neptune differs from Uranus in its appearance, although their basic atmospheric temperatures are similar. The upper clouds are composed of methane, which forms a thin cloud layer near the top of the troposphere. Most the atmosphere above this level is clear and transparent, with less haze than is found on Uranus. The scattering of sunlight by gas molecules lends Neptune a pale blue color similar to that of Earth’s atmosphere. Another cloud layer, perhaps composed of hydrogen sulfide ice particles, exists below the methane clouds.</p>

      <h3>Pluto Close-up</h3>
      <p>Pluto is not a moon, but its size and composition are similar to many moons in the outer solar system. Our understanding of Pluto (and its large moon Charon) have changed dramatically as a result of the NASA New Horizons flyby in 2015.</p>
      <p>From the time of its discovery, it was clear that Pluto was not a giant like the other four outer solar system planets. For a long time, it was thought that the mass of Pluto was similar to that of Earth, so that it was classed as a fifth terrestrial planet, somehow misplaced in the far outer reaches of the solar system. There were other anomalies, however, as Pluto’s orbit was more eccentric and inclined to the plane of our solar system than that of any other planet. Only after the discovery of its moon Charon in 1978 could the mass of Pluto be measured, and it turned out to be far less than the mass of Earth.</p>
      <p>This graphic vividly shows how tiny Pluto (and its Moon Charon) is relative to a terrestrial planet like Earth. That is the primary justification for putting Pluto in the class of dwarf planets rather than terrestrial planets.</p>
      <figure style="display: grid; justify-content: center;"><img decoding="async" src="https://pressbooks.online.ucf.edu/app/uploads/sites/40/2018/12/OSC_Astro_12_03_DwarfScale-1.jpg" alt="An image showing the comparison of the sizes of Pluto, Charon, and Earth. Earth is roughly six times larger than Pluto, and Pluto is roughly three times larger than its moon, Charon.">
        <figcaption class="right">Credit: modification of work by NASA</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In addition to Charon, Pluto has four small moons. Subsequent observations of Charon showed that this moon is in a retrograde orbit and has a diameter of about 1200 kilometers, more than half the size of Pluto itself. This makes Charon the moon whose size is the largest fraction of its parent planet. We could even think of Pluto and Charon as a double world (Tatooine?). Seen from Pluto, Charon would be as large as eight full moons on Earth.</p>
      <p>To many astronomers, Pluto seemed like the odd cousin that everyone hopes will not show up at the next family reunion. Neither its path around the Sun nor its size resembles either the giant planets or the terrestrial planets. In the 1990s, astronomers began to discover additional small objects in the far outer solar system, showing that Pluto was not alone after all. One of these objects, called Eris is nearly the same size as Pluto, and another, Makemake, is substantially smaller. It became clear to astronomers that Pluto was so different from the other planets that it needed a new classification. Therefore, it was called a <em>dwarf planet</em>, meaning a planet much smaller than the terrestrial planets. We now know of many small objects in the vicinity of Pluto and we have classified several as dwarf planets.</p>
      <p>A similar history was associated with the discovery of the asteroids. When the first asteroid (Ceres) was discovered at the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was hailed as a new planet. In the following years, however, other objects were found with similar orbits to Ceres. Astronomers decided that these should not all be considered planets, so they invented a new class of objects, called minor planets or asteroids. Today, Ceres is also called a dwarf planet. Both minor planets and dwarf planets are part of a whole belt or zones of similar objects.</p>

      <h2>Smaller Members of the Solar System</h2>
      <p>Most of the planets are accompanied by one or more moons; only Mercury and Venus move through space alone. There are more than 180 known moons orbiting planets and dwarf planets, and undoubtedly many other small ones remain undiscovered. The largest of the moons are as big as small planets and just as interesting. In addition to our Moon, they include the four largest moons of Jupiter (called the Galilean moons, after their discoverer) and the largest moons of Saturn and Neptune (confusingly named Titan and Triton).</p>
      <p>Each of the giant planets also has rings made up of countless small bodies ranging in size from mountains to mere grains of dust, all in orbit about the equator of the planet. The bright rings of Saturn are, by far, the easiest to see. They are among the most beautiful sights in the solar system. But, all four ring systems are interesting to scientists because of their complicated forms, influenced by the pull of the moons that also orbit these giant planets.</p>
      <h3>Asteroid Eros</h3>
      <figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://pressbooks.online.ucf.edu/app/uploads/sites/40/2018/12/OSC_Astro_07_01_Asteroid-1.jpg" alt="Image of the Asteroid Eros. Like nearly all asteroids, Eros is not spherical but very irregular in shape, in this case similar to a potato. The surface is pock-marked with many craters.">
        <figcaption>Credit: modification of work by NASA/JHUAPL</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This small Earth-crossing asteroid image was taken by the NEAR-Shoemaker spacecraft from an altitude of about 100 kilometers. This view of the heavily cratered surface is about 10 kilometers wide. The spacecraft orbited Eros for a year before landing gently on its surface.</p>
      <p>Another class of small bodies is composed mostly of ice, made of frozen gases such as water, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide; these objects are called comets. Comets also are remnants from the formation of the solar system, but they were formed and continue (with rare exceptions) to orbit the Sun in distant, cooler regions—stored in a sort of cosmic deep freeze. This is also the realm of the larger icy worlds, called dwarf planets.</p>
      <h3>Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P)</h3>
      <figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://pressbooks.online.ucf.edu/app/uploads/sites/40/2018/12/OSC_Astro_07_01_Comet-1.jpg" alt="Image of Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P). Two lobes of this irregularly shaped object are illuminated by sunlight coming from the upper left. Bright streaks of material are seen radiating away from the sunlit surfaces of the comet. These streaks are not seen coming from the shaded portions.">

      <p>This image shows Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko, also known as 67P, near its closest approach to the Sun in 2015, as seen from the Rosetta spacecraft. Note the jets of gas escaping from the solid surface.</p>
      <p>Finally, there are countless grains of broken rock, which we call cosmic dust, scattered throughout the solar system. When these particles enter Earth’s atmosphere (as millions do each day) they burn up, producing a brief flash of light in the night sky known as a meteor (meteors are often referred to as shooting stars). Occasionally, some larger chunk of rocky or metallic material survives its passage through the atmosphere and lands on Earth. Any piece that strikes the ground is known as a meteorite. (You can see meteorites on display in many natural history museums and can sometimes even purchase pieces of them from gem and mineral dealers.)</p>
      <h3>TL;DR</h3>
      <p>Our solar system currently consists of the Sun, eight planets, five dwarf planets, nearly 200 known moons, and a host of smaller objects. The planets can be divided into two groups: the inner terrestrial planets and the outer giant planets. Pluto, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake do not fit into either category; as icy dwarf planets, they exist in an ice realm on the fringes of the main planetary system. The giant planets are composed mostly of liquids and gases. Smaller members of the solar system include asteroids (including the dwarf planet Ceres), which are rocky and metallic objects found mostly between Mars and Jupiter; comets, which are made mostly of frozen gases and generally orbit far from the Sun; and countless smaller grains of cosmic dust. When a meteor survives its passage through our atmosphere and falls to Earth, we call it a meteorite. ☄️</p>
