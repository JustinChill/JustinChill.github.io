      <!-- Seinfeld anecdote about parking space -->

      <p><em>"Parking lies at the intersection of transportation and land use, a bastard field of study shunned by both architects and traffic engineers</em>,” writes Henry Grabar, who proves to be an adept driver when navigating this complex topic.</p>
      <p>It's natural for a book about parking regulations to be a tedious read. That couldn't be farther from the case here, as Grabar shares tales of anger, violence, theft, lust, greed, political chicanery and transportation policy gone wrong. The protagonist — and the villain — in this story is the car. The theme is our culture’s propensity to value automobile ownership over almost everything else, and at a heavy, invisible cost to society.</p>
      <p>“Paved Paradise” opened my eyes to just how profoundly parking itself has contributed to the uglification of urban life, creating, “<em>a super-mundane environment that people just want to move through.</em>” The author notes a disconcerting fact about “The Sims” videogame, which tried to simulate the world as accurately as possible but had to cut back dramatically on the overwhelming presence of parking lots for its simulated city. An accurate visual representation was too grim and monochrome for gamers to enjoy.</p>

        <p>The problem is more than aestetics though; it’s money — money that could theoretically be used for other things. The unseen costs of parking are enormous, going far beyond quarters fed to a meter and garage fees.</p>
        <p>Look at housing. The cost of parking requirements for new real estate developments is in the billions, passed on in the form of higher payments for mortgage and rent. This contributes, Grabar contends, to a housing crisis that renders great swaths of vibrant American cities unaffordable to younger generations, with increasing numbers living in tent encampments on public sidewalks (and parking lots!) in what still counts as the world’s most prosperous nation.</p>

        <p>Heinrich Kramer's <em>Malleus Maleficarum</em> (Hammer of Witches), published in 1487, led to mass panic across Europe as people feared witches in their communities and even in their own families. The power of the printed word allowed the sensationalist stories and lurid details to spread far and wide.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>The witch hunts demonstrate that the spread of sensational and false information can lead to mass hysteria and tragic outcomes. They highlight the power of narrative and the dangers of unchecked information, showing how belief systems can be influenced by social dynamics rather than objective truths.</p>
