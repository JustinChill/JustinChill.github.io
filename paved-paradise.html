      <!-- Seinfeld anecdote about parking space -->
      <p>If you own a car, you need to park it somewhere. This is so embedded in American culture that Seinfeld has <a href="https://driving.ca/features/feature-story/these-are-the-10-best-seinfeld-episodes-centered-on-cars">at least</a> three episodes about parking, including <em>the Parking Garage</em> and <em>the Parking Space</em>. As cars have proliferated, so have parking lots and garages, parking regulations and advanced tech. <em>"Parking lies at the intersection of transportation and land-use, a bastard field of study shunned by both architects and traffic engineers</em>,” writes author Henry Grabar, who proves an adept driver navigating this complex topic.</p>
      <p>A book about parking regulations doesn't exactly scream page turner. Grabar has a journalists's flair for making a story out of people, rather than boring statistics, to explain how parking requirements subsidize car ownership, increase the cost while reducing the supply of housing, intensify traffic congestion, pollute the air and water, limit walkability, degrade urban design, hinder the economy, penalize those who don't own a car, and accelerate global warming. In effect, people who cannot afford to own a car pay higher prices for food so richer drivers can park for free at the grocery store.</p>
      <p>“Paved Paradise” opened my eyes to just how profoundly parking itself has contributed to the depressing blight of urban life, creating, “<em>a super-mundane environment that people just want to move through.</em>” The author notes a disconcerting fact about “The Sims” videogame, which tried to simulate the world as accurately as possible but had to cut back dramatically on the size of parking lots in its simulated city. An accurate visual representation was too grim and overwhelming for gamers to enjoy<a href="#lat" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="lat-ref"></a>.</p>
      <q>Parking is one of the few things we expect to be available at or near our destination, for free, year round.</q>

      <h2>The high cost of free parking</h2>

        <p>The problem is more than aesthetics; it’s real money lost that could theoretically be used for other things. The unseen costs of parking are enormous, going far beyond quarters fed to the meter and garage fees. Building on Donald Shoup’s 2005 <em>The Hidden Cost of Free Parking</em>, Grabar argues that if you look at parking as a use of land, we have it backward. In expensive cities, the most desired parking&dash; curbside&dash; is free or nearly free, while the least desired parking&dash; garages&dash; is expensive. That leads to drivers incentivized to circle the block seeking an open space.</p>
      </section>

      <p>Take housing for example. Grabar notes that the cost of parking requirements for new real estate developments is in the <strong>billions</strong>, passed on in the form of higher payments for mortgage and rent. City planning has been much better at housing cars than housing people. From a land-use perspective, it’s perverse that some of the most valuable land in America goes at market rates if you want to live there but is free if you park a car there.</p>
      <p>In Grabar’s analysis, which jibes with the work of 1960s urbanists like Jane Jacobs who fought for more affordable, more attractive, more walkable cities, the costs of parking have been subsidized too long. Jacobs was one of the first to argue that more parking means more traffic and a dehumanization of city life. Grabar notes that cities which balked at increasing residential parking requirements&mdash; San Francisco, Boston, New Orleans&mdash; are among the country’s most walkable.</p>

      <h2>Walkable cities</h2>
      <p>It's mentioned in passing that one reason so many Americans are nostalgic for college campus life is that it’s one of the few times that they’ve lived in a walkable setting. On a real college campus, however, parking is more fraught. Most community colleges don’t have dorms, and even those that do typically only house a small fraction of their student body. Mass transit options in the United States are sorely lacking, especially outside large cities. Some colleges use parking as a revenue stream, separating lots by status (faculty parking, student parking, etc.) and relying on tickets to pay the bills.</p>
      <h2>Cars & Covid</h2>
      <p>With COVID, of course, the game changed. Parking lots were repurposed. Restaurants claimed them for outdoor dining. Colleges used them for graduations. Churches used them for services.</p>

      <h2>What can be done?</h2>
      <p>Grabar recommends some obvious policy changes, most of which involve deemphasizing parking in land use and trying to get parking prices right. Make curbside parking expensive, and people will be more willing to pay for garages, thereby reducing traffic from people circling blocks looking for spaces. More will also switch to alternative transit options or e-bikes, depending on their situation<a href="#prf" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="prf-ref"></a>. Reducing the parking ratios required for stores, restaurants and the like can make for denser development, which makes places more walkable. Grabar even ventures (bravely) into housing policy, noting that moves to allow large-scale conversion of garages into dwelling units in California represents a badly needed shift from housing cars to housing people.</p>
      <p>One upside of the mess that parking requirement have created is an accidental land reserve available for conversion from asphalt for cars to space for people. If (when?) city planners renounce parking requirements, America can reclaim land roughly equal to the size of the Netherlands. That <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/nyregion/parklets-parking-spaces.html">potential is enormous</a>, from parklets and outdoor seating to full dining sheds. We cannot change the past, but we can change the future, and in <em>Paved Paradise</em> Henry Grabar shows us a way ahead.</p>
