      <p>Grand Theft Auto is one of the most successful entertainment products in history. With global sales for of the game surpassing 215 million units as of May 2025, the cultural impact of Rockstar Games' series rivals that of Disney’s Mickey Mouse and George Lucas’ Star Wars. Unlike the wholesome narratives typically found in Disney programming, however, Rockstar’s series has positioned itself as a mature, often dark, and playful take on the American experience.</p>
      <hr  />
      <h2>TL;DR</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>GTA V uses satire to critique various aspects of American society and the American Dream through billboards, radio advertising, and missions that parody real-life issues and brands.</li>
        <li>The extensive use of satire is a form of a "satirical play" with the detailed game world the stage, the characters providing the storyline, and the player's actions driving the narrative.</li>
        <li>Since its launch a decade ago, GTA5 has generated $5.2 billion in digital revenues and $3.1 billion in physical sales. GTA 6, expected in May 2026, is expected to generate $2.7 billion at launch.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr  />
      <p>British-founded Rockstar Games delights in exploring what is means to be American. Alongside other franchises like LA Noire (2011) and Red Dead Redemption (2004+), Grand Theft Auto (GTA) is fundamentally an exploration of North American geography and culture. Rockstar offers a unique outsider's perspective on the American condition, presented through a richly detailed game world and the minority backgrounds of its playable characters, who are themselves often  outside the mainstream U.S.</p>
      <!-- <p>Rockstar’s programming teams spend significant time analyzing and decoding specific elements of the American experience to bring digital America to life in the Grand Theft Auto series. For Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser, the results are clear: “GTA is America<a href="#guardian" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="guardian-ref"></a>”.</p>  -->
      <p>However, similar to how Disney cartoons appropriate and adapt classic European folk stories, Rockstar’s digital rendering of the United States involves significant alteration. If “Disney’s America” is filled with sentimentality, optimism, innocence, and pride, “Rockstar’s America” is a world of pop culture, money, machismo, and violence.</p>
      <p>Critical commentary of the American Dream is delivered through environmental immersion, character narrative, and mission-based play. In the first part of this article, I examine this environmental immersion through two case studies: radio and billboard advertising. Rockstar also satirizes the American Dream through its character-driven narratives, often drawing on “cut scene” techniques pioneered in the film industry. In the second half of this article, I explore this element from the perspective of lead character Michael’s voice, especially his “inner” voice shared during a series of psychotherapy sessions in the game.</p> 
      <p>Two missions are also explored in depth: the main quest of “LifeInvader,” in which the player sabotages a company emblematic of California Big Tech, and an online side quest simply called the “American Dream.” Such missions are paramount in connecting the player’s own actions with the game’s cynicism toward the American experience.</p>
      <h2>California screamin'</h2>
      <p>Intriguingly, a game known for car jacking and violent assault has become a popular treatise on one of the most celebrated national beliefs: the American Dream. Rooted in revolution and the overthrow of colonial powers, the American Dream has evolved into an amorphous but alluring myth celebrating individualism, freedom, opportunity, materialism, and personal success.</p> 
      <p>From Langston Hughes to Hunter S. Thompson, critics have highlighted the limits and failings of the so-called American Dream, particularly its inaccessibility to minorities and the working classes. That critical media commentary now extends to games, with the Grand Theft Auto series offering valuable social commentary on the twenty-first-century version of the American Dream.</p>
      <p>In narrative terms, character stories across the series highlight the futility of upward social mobility, or “uplift.” Consider the story of Niko Bellic in GTA IV, an Eastern European war veteran arriving in New York City hopeful of what a new nation can offer, but caught instead in a cycle of crime and violence. As <a href="https://septentrio.uit.no/index.php/eludamos/article/view/vol4no2-6">Marc Ouellette</a> notes, GTA provides “a relentless repudiation of the American Dream and its inherent contradictory ideologies”.</p> 
      <p>GTA V is a sprawling tale of three criminal maniacs self-destructing in a blood-splattered spree from one crisis to another. Michael De Santa is a middle-aged thug, obsessed with movies, who is living a comfortable life undercover after a deal brokered with the feds. When his old partner Trevor Philips, a sociopath who cooks meth out in the desert, turns up in town, the two join forces with a young black kid, Franklin Marshall, who's set on leaving his gang-infested neighborhood behind.</p>
      <p>While Michael’s story explores white privilege, indulgences and frustrations surrounding living the Dream, Franklin’s story, as a young African American residing in a poverty-stricken part of Los Santos, underlines issues of economic and social exclusion. The gameplay experience aims to highlight the ironies and contradictions of modern American capitalism and casts doubts over the survival of a national myth.</p>
      <!-- In a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/07/grand-theft-auto-dan-houser">2013 interview</a>, Houser explained how, “If GTA IV was a classic New York story, this [GTA V] is the endpoint of the American Dream”. -->
      <p>The Grand Theft Auto series is not unique in its critical assessment of the American Dream, with California, particularly Los Angeles, the focus. In his classic Beat novel <em>The Dharma Bums</em> (1958), Jack Kerouac described L.A. as “a regular hell” where “the air stank” and “the smog was heavy”. In the 1980s, writer Carolyn See surmised the appeal of Los Angeles as “It looks good, but that’s it”, and pronounced “the West Coast is the end of the road for the American Dream”.</p> 
      <p>The franchise plays to a long history of conceptualizing the West Coast as a realm of both bright futures and dark fortunes. Of interest here is how far Grand Theft Auto extends existing narratives and offers new interpretations through interactive design.</p> 
      <!-- Rockstar explores the American experience chiefly through the prism of parody in a wonderfully intricate role-playing game. -->
      <p>On its release in 2013, journalist Keith <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/16/gta-5-review-grand-theft-auto-v">Stuart described</a> GTA V as “a freewheeling, nihilistic satire on western society” and a “monstrous parody of modern life”, while politician Tom Watson labeled the game “a giant, targeted missile of satire”. The contribution of dark humor is widely credited for the game’s success. Kiri Miller notes how the series “appeals to players attuned to political parody and popular culture,” allowing players to perform violent acts in the game but see them as distant, fake, and ironic.</p>
      <p>Writing about the phenomenon of “play-fighting” in GTA III, Tanner Higgin highlights how in-game digital violence can be both “satiric and cathartic” for the individual gamer. More interested in the underlying political message of the series, Dennis Redmond sees Grand Theft Auto as “uproarious satire” marked by a “willingness to shine a spotlight on the dank underbelly of the U.S. Empire”. Parody thus shapes much of the GTA gaming experience.</p>
      
      <img src="https://www.killscreen.com/content/images/previously/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/gta5_train_big.jpg" alt="GTA 5 screenshot of a train and man parachuting." loading="lazy" srcset="https://www.killscreen.com/content/images/size/w600/previously/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/gta5_train_big.jpg 600w, https://www.killscreen.com/content/images/previously/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/gta5_train_big.jpg 880w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px" class="mid-size rounded">
      <p>Collectively the game's mechanisms produce a distinctive form of digitally enhanced <strong>satirical play</strong>. Traditionally referring to the art of drama and live theatre, a satirical play is a performance marked by dark humor and ridicule, often targeting the government, corporations, or social institutions for their misdoings. Historic examples include Shakespeare’s <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> and <em>Hamlet</em>.</p> 
      <p>The term “satirical play” might be expanded to other forms of performance that feature parody and ridicule. In the 1960s, Stanley Kubrick's <em>Dr. Strangelove</em> (1964) provided playful satire on American geopolitics and the Cold War. In recent decades, satire-based television programs such as <em>South Park</em>, <em>Seinfeld</em>, and <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> have met with commercial and artistic acclaim.</p>
      <p>Applied as a video game, satirical play takes on similar but arguably more expansive meanings. The “open stage” becomes the game world, the actors become both playable and non-playable game characters, and the message is delivered through a range of mutually enforcing mechanisms. The dramatic narrative is transmitted not just through character dialogue and thoughtful game world details but, uniquely, through player agency. While the satire of a Shakespearean theatrical play is largely “delivered” to a watchful audience, satire in a video game unfolds directly through action as well as experience.</p>       
      <!-- <p>The distinctive form of satirical play offered in GTA V is not without flaws, however. Moments of disillusionment and deeper narrative insight are punctured by simple mission priorities and money-chasing, creating moments of ludonarrative dissonance, a problem also found in the gameplay of GTA IV. The player’s own pursuit of end-goals, monetary rewards, and completed missions awkwardly mirrors Dream attainment. </p> -->
      <!-- <aside><strong>Ludonarrative dissonance</strong> is the conflict between a video game's narrative told through the non-interactive elements and the narrative told through the gameplay. The term was coined by game designer Clint Hocking in a 2007 blog post.</aside> -->

      <h2>Radio Stations, Billboards, and Advertising</h2>
      <!-- <h3>Experiencing the American Dream Indirectly</h3> -->
      <p>Modeled on Los Angeles, the digital landscape of Los Santos in GTA V provides a lavish and largely cohesive recreation of everyday life. Working-class Latino non-playable characters tend lawns in the rich area of Rockford Hills (Beverly Hills) and return home by bus in the evenings to their homes in East Los Santos (East LA), while the sun sets across the city, resetting game tasks and the in-game stock exchange. Random events and encounters with strangers are dynamic elements that add depth and unpredictability to the game. These events can occur spontaneously as you explore the game world, or they can be triggered by specific actions or locations. </p> 
      <section>
        <p>The mechanics of environmental immersion—of feeling part of a living, breathing simulation of Southern California—includes a range of highly accessible satirical content (or immersive satire), in the form of <a href="https://gta5billboards.ssstuart.net/">billboards</a>, radio advertising, and websites as well as in-game social media and television commercials.</p>
        <img src="https://gta5billboards.ssstuart.net/pictures/billboards/billboardGW.png" alt="Global Warming is Baloney ad by Terroil" class="item-left rounded" loading="lazy">
        <p>Billboards dot the freeways of Los Santos, featuring an impressive range of products and services available. All told, GTA V contains approximately 550 billboards selling everything from fast food and dieting, lawyers and realtors, credit and debt associations, coffee and donuts, plastic surgery, and reality television. Everything is “for sale” and eminently consumable.</p> 
        <p>The billboards underline a way of life based around themes of limitless money, excess consumption, and mass gullibility. Advertising offers a window into what people buy, and is employed as a powerful device for storytelling, world building, and cultural commentary. </p>
      </section>
      <p>Over exaggerations and lies rule this world of billboard advertising. Fleeca Banks, for example, attracts customers by promising “Money for nothing, no problem.” "Slip and fall into the good life with the top employment law firm in San Andreas” boasts the website of law firm Hammerstein & Faust. Cluckin Bell, likely inspired by fast food chain Chick-fil-A, sells its chicken as “better than roadkill”—revealing the poor quality of local fast food but equally the mass acceptance of that poor quality (Made "with" real chicken...). Gun store Ammu-Nation warns freeway drivers, “take a break before you kill someone,” presenting Americans as a people on the edge of violence but then catering to and even encouraging such urges in pursuit of profit.</p>
      <img src="https://gta5billboards.ssstuart.net/pictures/billboards/billboardCBY.jpg" alt="Cluckin' Bell- putting the yolk into yolkel" class="" loading="lazy">
      <h3>Tune in, tune out</h3>
      <p>Traveling between destinations, completing missions, and joyriding, the player spends considerable time sitting inside vehicles. The car radio always entertains during these periods and is one of my favorite features in the game. The in-game radio can tune into sixteen stations playing more than 441 tracks of licensed music, as well as two talk radio stations (“Weazel News, Confirming your prejudices!”).</p>
      <p>The radio is largely unavoidable in-game and a wickedly effective satirical tool. The player, by their choice of station, helps shape the vein of the satire. Blaine County Radio, for example, is Rockstar’s version of conservative talk radio. In the song “I Like Things Just the Way They Are,” frequently played on Blaine, the country singer Samantha Muldoon longs for a world of “old American values” where people “pray at the start of every football game” and “smoke in restaurants,” with “everything pure, just like in the South.” Muldoon targets the liberal political agenda, singing, “you lefties have just taken things too far.” Rockstar thus parodies conservative Americans longing for a time when, as Muldoon sings, “things were just great,” and the American Dream embodied Christian conservative values.</p>
      <img src="https://gta5billboards.ssstuart.net/pictures/billboards/billboardAR.png" alt="Anna Rex clothing ad." loading="lazy">
      <p>The radio also features over one hundred advertisements. Catchy jingles and hyped up narrators sell fast food and alcohol rehabilitation to the masses. Mainstream U.S. brands are parodied. The commercial for Up-n-Atom Burger (In-N-Out Burger) has the taglines, “from a time when America didn’t worry about global warming, cholesterol or who can vote,” and “from when we were morally superior.” The burger chain has a retro, 1950s inspired diner style similar to Johnny Rockets restaurants. Other radio adverts, such as the campaign for the fictitious Proposition 14, pine for a return to the “golden age” of the Twenties and the return of Prohibition. In these examples, Rockstar presents the Dream as an expired concept out of touch with contemporary American needs and issues. You can practically hear the chants to "Make Los Santos Great Again!"</p>
      <p>Other radio advertisements sell the American Dream as a contemporary consumer phenomenon. They capture a sense of the Dream as primarily one of purchase power and personal excess, in the 2010s very much connected to the rise of new technologies, plastic surgeries, and real estate ownership, with scant regard for the plight of those less fortunate.</p> 
      <p>Excess proves a common theme on the radio, reinforcing the popular idea of Americans as super-consumers. Windsor Real Estate advertises its services to the Los Santos rich with the line, “Look down on people, live the American Dream residing in a Mansion with an immigrant who hates you,” and casts home ownership as fundamentally a matter of size, luxury, and status. </p> 
      <p>Radio advertising also plays on popular anxieties. Strangely upbeat announcers warn their listeners of a fast-unfolding dystopia where the American Dream has no reach or relevance. They highlight social and environmental problems about to overwhelm Los Santos and the wider San Andreas community.</p> 
      <p>Taco Bomb (Taco Bell) promotes itself as a chain that has “fed students, poor people, and drunks since the 1970s” (the first restaurant actually opened in 1962). The Prison Industrial Complex (P.I.C) advertises for more correctional officers by noting how “the West Coast leads the country in correctional facilities”. Proposition 45 calls for mandatory gun ownership and concealed carry for Americans so that they can protect themselves in an increasingly violent world. "Your lifestyle doesn't need to change just because you've maxed out your credit cards. Don't worry about your Interest rate! Consolidate!" proclaims an ad for Credit Card Consolidation Kings.</p> 
      <p>References on the radio of Los Santos falling apart are easily confirmed by the player looking out their windshield. Evidence of the failed experiment of the American Dream is hard to miss across areas of Los Santos. In-game locations such as Strawberry and Rancho in South Los Santos depict the conditions of real-life Crenshaw, Watts, and Florence.</p>
      <img src="http://lenscratch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/15.jpg" alt="Morten Rockford Ravn photo" width="960" height="536" class="mid-size" loading="lazy">
      <p>Artist <a href="https://lenscratch.com/2017/04/morten-rockford-ravn-enter-fear-and-loathing-in-gta-v/">Morten Rockford Ravn</a> has documented the depravity of Los Santos in a series of digital street photographs, published online, that highlight the social wasteland. Inspired by Hunter S. Thompson’s novel <em>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</em> (1971) and “gonzo journalism,” Ravn’s pictures depict homeless men and their carrier bags on Del Perro Beach, abandoned gas stations, and cutthroat gangs on street corners. The pictures collectively impart a ghostly image of depravity and decay, and of American society some distance from the realization of the American Dream, digital or otherwise.</p>
      <p>The billboards and jingles of Grand Theft Auto V impart a dual message to the player. With their overt, brazen parody, they remind the player of the theater, fantasy, and illusion of the game world; that GTA exists as an outlandish and hyperreal representation of America. Secondly, Rockstar’s adverts reveal disturbing facts about real-life society. In-game company slogans offer more truth than their real-life counterparts.</p> 
      <p>When FlyUS air fleet uses the slogan “Sit back, relax, and shut up,” that message resonates with anyone who has ever flown Spirit or Frontier Airlines. The satirical point of billboards and jingles in Grand Theft Auto is frequently to highlight how the American service economy may claim to offer its customers the American Dream, but how that lifestyle remains ephemeral and out of reach.</p>

      <h3>Listening to Michael’s Inner Voice</h3>
      <p>As in The Sopranos, therapy sessions serve as a lens into a characters psyche, family dynamics, and the complexities of the criminal underworld. Grand Theft Auto V begins in earnest with Michael attending a therapy session with his psychiatrist Dr. Isiah Friedlander. A frustrated and angry Michael reflects on how the “opportunities” and “achievements” of crime have allowed him to live a rich and quiet life with his family in Rockford Hills. However, instead of feeling any sense of ease or contentment, Michael is overwhelmed by the “overriding futility” of Los Santos life. Describing his life as, “...at the end of the road! With a big house and a useless kid and I’m stuck talking to you because no one else gives a shit.” He shouts angrily at Dr. Friedlander, “Oh, I’m living the dream, baby, and that dream is fucked!”</p>
      <p>Michael’s reflection on how his own American Dream has gone sour provides the starting point to GTA V. The game begins with a man who self-consciously identifies with “living the dream” but feels trapped in the disillusionment that it holds. The opening film-like credit sequence that immediately follows Michael’s therapy session asserts a similar narrative of the American Dream gone bad. A montage of classic images of Southern California— million-dollar apartments with ocean views, yoga classes and luxury yachts, muscle men on muscle beach and women lounging in bikinis, all set to a US flag before the California sun—remind the player of the “sunny side” of Los Angeles, and the “made it” culture of the burgeoning metropolis in the early aughts. The montage resembles typical television advertising for vacations by Visit California marketing or the beach life in TV series like Baywatch (1989-1999).</p> 
      <p>The camera then comes to rest at the Del Perro (Santa Monica) boardwalk, on a police officer shooing away a drunken vagrant, Michael sauntering moodily by, and our third playable character, Franklin, planning to “repossess” a sports car from one of the luxury ocean-view apartments. With the shift toward illegal activities on the boardwalk, the sunny-side framing of the California Dream quickly evaporates and a darker, criminal world emerges. The noir is there, even in the direct California sunlight.</p>
      <p>Similar to characters in a book, the narratives of Michael, Franklin, and Trevor Philips serve as the “storyline” for the player. While Franklin, an African American caught in poverty, is presented as someone who is, by race and status, striving for but consistently denied the Dream, and Trevor, as psychopath and killer, seems to outwardly reject any social norms or ideals, the character of Michael is most revealing precisely because he is ostensibly a Los Santos success story.</p>
      <p>Michael has achieved success mostly through nefarious schemes, and his character clearly identifies with the twenty-first-century goals of real estate, family, comfort, and riches. His property in the Rockford Hills is an archetypal Hollywood mansion, with its own electronically gated access, movie room, and swimming pool. He also owns a luxury yacht and has an attractive wife and two kids. However, as revealed through his therapy sessions as well as conversations with Franklin, Michael is struck how unfulfilled he actually feels. The luxury lifestyle seems innately hollow and aimless, with most of his free time spent watching daytime television coupled with daytime drinking. As he laments to Dr. Friedlander, “I’m rich, I’m miserable.”</p> 
      <p>Michael’s nuclear family also seems highly dysfunctional and disconnected. He moans to Friedlander about his lazy and privileged son Jimmy, who has all the advantages in the world but no compulsion to work. His wife Amanda cheats behind his back with her tennis coach and bemoans in a group session Michael’s endless “sarcasm.” While outwardly a strong and rich man “living the dream”, the opposite, or noir side, is revealed in each of his seven therapy sessions. Inwardly, Michael feels imposter syndrome living in Rockford Hills, with the quiet existence a decidedly poor fit for his rebellious character. As Michael points out to Amanda in a family therapy session, “we’re trailer trash, you and me.” This sense of “roleplaying” the American Dream is further underscored by Dr. Friedlander’s own commentary when he probes Michael on his true feelings and motivations.</p>
      <p>Michael’s lingering desire to operate outside the classical American Dream also underlines its greater insufficiency. For Michael, the draws of returning to crime outweigh the rewards offered by continuing to “live the Dream.” In his third session with Dr. Friedlander, while accepting that falling back into a life of crime signified a “bad relapse,” Michael professes how it “felt good,” and far more exciting than his usual banal existence. Crime seems to be a part of Michael’s individual calling, or even human nature. In their final session together, Michael imparts to Dr. Friedlander, “I want to be a good dad, love my family, live the dream,” but that the call of crime always conquers those “sunshine” daydreams.</p>
      <p>For the player, regularly occupying Michael’s shoes, as well as attending his therapy sessions, crime also seems more captivating than comfortable living (after all, the Grand Theft Auto series is known as a game about car chases and killing, not sitting on the sofa watching Rehab Island on TV). In a meta twist, Rockstar has Michael frequently question if someone is mysteriously controlling him. Dr. Friedlander also consistently asks Michael to stop “acting out.” Such mechanisms help the player listen to Michael’s inner voices but also encourage reflection on their own experiences of American life. Satirical play involves "being" Michael but also being a player that appreciates and develops their own critical and ironic perspective.</p>
      <p><strong>Ludonarrative dissonance</strong> in video games refers to the conflict or inconsistency between a game's narrative (story, themes, and characters) and its gameplay mechanics. This disconnect can occur when the story conveys certain messages or emotions that are undermined or contradicted by the actions and mechanics required during gameplay. For example, a game that promotes a narrative of peace and non-violence but requires the player to engage in frequent combat can create ludonarrative dissonance. This term is used to describe the jarring effect that can result from such inconsistencies, potentially impacting the player's immersion and overall experience.</p>
      <p>While Michael may insist that the “dream is fucked,” for the player, the richness of experiences in Los Santos suggest very much otherwise. Rather than heeding Michael’s advice, the player is encouraged through game mechanics of accumulation and reward to instead chase the material possessions and custom cars offered in Los Santos.</p>
      <h2>Playing to Win</h2>
      <p>Games are usually played to generate self-esteem, test reflexes, and for the reward of winning. In Grand Theft Auto V, “winning” entails completing a range of missions (both main story and secondary side quests) that advance the game’s overall narrative and cater to the player’s desire for progress and achievement. True to form, most missions involve, to some degree, criminality, violence, automobile theft, and killing. By completing mission objectives, players actively experience satirical set pieces and, by their own character dialogue and action choices, contribute to the drama.</p>
      <p>One early mission involves a calculated attack on American social media giant LiveInvader, a thinly veiled parody of Facebook. LiveInvader is Los Santos' leading social media provider, with most game-characters using its app and having their own online profiles. The technology corporation aggressively markets its new products with slogans such as “Peek, Pry, Populate” and “Create Friends today.” Other in-game companies advertise on LiveInvader and encourage the player to click on their corporate profiles (“Stalk us on LifeInvader!”). The encouragement to “stalk” spoofs the Facebook “like” button and our culture of obsessively following others on social media, which has only grown worse since the games introduction.</p>
      <p>Michael’s associate Lester Crest nurtures a hatred for the technology company and tasks the player with sabotaging the company. Lester provides Michael with a tiny package (containing a computer chip) to be attached to the new LifeInvader prototype sequestered at the corporation’s headquarters. The mission involves Michael, undercover as pretend employee, gaining the trust of co-workers at the LifeInvader office, before targeting the prototype. The office is an environment rich in parody of the California technology industry. Wall posters motivate employees to “live tomorrow,” while recreational spaces include a “yoga zone,” a “sweat lodge,” and an “imagineering” room (a likely reference to Disney Imagineering). Oblivious too Lester's ultimate aims or the true contents of the package, Michael calls the CEO of the company Jay Norris as he presents the device at a Keynote event live on television; the telephone call triggers the sabotaged prototype device to explode and kill the company's leader.</p>
      <p>The LifeInvader mission critiques life in Silicon Valley and mocks the values espoused by Big Tech. Rockstar challenges the culture of tech-companies where employees are encouraged to embrace their creativity, worship new age slogans, and sit in beanbags instead of chairs. Norris, the CEO, is presented as a charismatic Steve Jobs-like character who emphatically imparts his ruthless ambition as well as his techno-optimism. He promotes his youthful, next-generation workforce (who average “14.4 years in age”) and talks of “weapons grade domination” of the technology sector thanks to his new mobile devices.</p>
      <p>Intriguing, given its own role in the video game sector, Rockstar gets the player to target a technology giant. By assisting Lester, Michael (and the player) become unwitting accomplices to murder. By targeting LifeInvader, they also take aim at the millennial generation’s American Dream rooted in technology, futurism, and social media likes.</p>
      <p>To obtaining the trophy titled “American Dream” requires a car and car insurance, an the purchase of an apartment with parking. The focus on car ownership reflects both the centrality of the automobile in American culture and Grand Theft Auto’s elevation of the car as the ultimate status symbol.</p>
      <p>The attainment of this trophy is also largely a matter of money. At least $80,000 is required for a suitable residential investment, although most players spend substantially more for the ideal apartment. This money is earned primarily by the player embarking on a range of illicit activities, including stealing cars and robbing banks. The “American Dream” is thus attained by successful displays of criminality.</p>
      <p>The LifeInvader mission and American Dream trophy highlight Rockstar's observations about the United States. Judged on your ability to overcome obstacles and generate wealth and power, “winning” in Grand Theft Auto proves not that dissimilar from winning in the real world. Rockstar actively encourages the player to seek out new resources and contacts in San Andreas. An in-game cash economy allows the player to gradually unlock new “luxuries” (from deluxe condos to modified dune buggies) as well as new missions and properties. The game also taunts players to work harder, their inferior status highlighted by those who have already “made it” in the city of Los Santos. For example, on a tour of Vinewood celebrity homes, the guide jovially informs you, “Remember, these people are rich and beautiful and that makes them better than us.”</p>
      <h3>The Satire of Play</h3>
      <p>That the player has an active (and sometimes frustrating) role in attaining their own digital “American Dream” highlights the co-authorship embedded in all video games. Unlike other entertainment media, storylines and outcomes depend on the input of the individual viewer. Additionally, in terms of Grand Theft Auto, the player is bombarded by a range of satirical commentary, from billboard slogans to mission agendas, as an intrinsic part of play. Not only is the player exposed to satirical commentary, but to a degree, the player contributes to the satire themselves by choices over where to look and travel to, in-game conversation options, and abetting associates with often outlandish criminal capers. The player is thus, at times, a “satirical player,” entangled in a broad web of dark humor and irony.</p>
      <p>Rockstar also grants the player the freedom to create their own content in GTA V. The “open world” format of the game, with its powerful physics engine and play possibilities, invites the player to explore and experiment. Part of the appeal of Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto series lies in its provision for imaginative play. In many ways, Los Santos represents a true “digital playground.” In an environment sated in satire, there lies the potential for players to contribute their own dark ironies and critical statements. As seen on YouTube channels, while some players focus on the accumulation of fast cars and money, others deviate from the standard template by exploring and creating modded luxury properties or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WW-vpZAFNw">taking selfies</a> next to strangers who loosely resemble celebrities.</p> 
      <p>Some ignore Rockstar’s structure entirely, and in a form of transgressive play, rebel against the “law” of the game, and actively resist the storyline by never working towards mission goals, and instead act out <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/what-is-gta-v-roleplay-how-to-play-streams-445146/">realistic life simulations</a>. Some creatives create their own dark pictures of the San Andreas landscape, while others seek to modify the game's code, and with it, Rockstar’s world, to play the title from a cop’s perspective or adding zombies. Gamers have even extended Rockstar’s definition of end game success through game modifications. In the popular <a href="https://www.gta5-mods.com/maps/marlow-village-enhanced-luxury-safehouse-25-parking-lots-1-helipad-710-props-210-peds">Marlowe Valley Mod</a>, players can move to an impressive new house in Marlowe Valley Vineyard with its own working bar, safe house, security, and airplane runway, thereby raising the bar on what a digital Dream entails.</p>
      <h3>The End of the American Dream</h3>
      <p>With the Grand Theft Auto series, Rockstar Games has extended satirical theater in new directions and imbued it with new levels of interactivity. Satire transforms from a passive form of comedy and commentary not just watched and enjoyed, but co-authored and co-developed through play. This is a significant progression and highlights how games can further our own sense of humor and creativity.</p>
      <p>GTA V is also renowned for its world building. From its characters and missions to the advertising and political slogans, the state of San Andreas is steeped in satire. Everyone is a target: left-wing and right-wing politicians alike, fast food diners, yoga devotees, and the torture industry (a controversial in-game torture scene was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/09/21/grand-theft-auto-v-torture-scene-is-satire/">defended by one Forbes journalist</a> as legitimate purely because of its “satire”). Even the video game industry and gamers themselves are ridiculed. Michael moans how his son “sits on his ass all day, smoking dope and jerking off while he plays that fucking game.” Greater satirical arcs surround both the excesses of capitalism and consumption, and the heritage and survival of the American Dream.</p>
      <p>At times, Rockstar’s criticism of American life is almost suffocating in its constancy, with its delivery across not just billboards and advertising, but through character dialogue and destinies, all encompassing. The designers themselves draw attention to this in-game phenomenon; Michael, for example, relating, “the world doesn’t need more sarcasm, it’s the blight of the age.” The player consistently participates in this process.</p>
      <p>Grand Theft Auto V is part of a long tradition of entertainment products that explore the fantasy/nightmare duality of Southern California. However, for most commentators, even those cynical of America’s place in the world, they still, at heart, express a desire for at least some part of the American Dream to ring true, and for places like Los Angeles to ultimately highlight its potential. As Joan Didion wrote of California in the 1960s, “Things had better work here, because here, beneath that immense bleached sky, is where we run out of continent”. Similarly, in the nostalgic musical film La La Land (2016), struggling actress Mia Dolan (Emma Stone) sings, “here’s to the ones who dream, foolish as they seem.”</p>
      <p>By contrast, Grand Theft Auto seems far more heartless and ruthless. Outwardly, GTA V operates on the premise that the American Dream has perhaps always been little more than an empty “myth” for most Americans. GTA V thrives in its depiction of the American Dream gone wrong: the sarcasm, the violence, and the “noir” is what makes the series so appealing. It crucially encourages players themselves to cynically shoot down the makers of great society, to target the police, the fire service, and innocent civilians. For centuries, the American Dream has inspired celebration, dedication, and broad-based belief. Today, by its global reach and sales figures, Grand Theft Auto preaches disillusionment on a mass scale. Such blatant disillusionment helps situate Rockstar’s title within a broader cultural moment in the United States, where culture wars, racial divisions, and a sense of wider unrest dominate. The game is, by design, a timely experience, marked by moments of intense violence, confrontation, and nihilism. GTA V is a good example of how video games speak to the contemporary American condition and can be used to explore some of the problems of U.S. society and politics.</p>
      <p>However, at times, the timely experience of GTA V is not of purposeful or meaningful design. Gamic goals clash with satirical play; instant rewards and gratifications undercut any greater narrative of disillusionment; and the freedom and opportunism of the game world belies the reality of an American Dream out of reach for many. In these ways, Rockstar’s critique of American life lacks well-programmed cohesion. Crucially, the flow of the game for most players is more cars, more money, and more trophy achievements, a digital realm where, in spite of the satire, the American Dream seems very much alive and kicking.</p>
