		<p>
		  Hill here saying hello there. This webpage will explain the layout and design of the website you're currently reading. It's the template for blog posts at <a href="www.justinchill.com">JustinChill.com</a>. Typography and design is inspired by some of the best examples of online content I could think of: <strong><a href="http://Pudding.cool">Pudding.cool</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.NYTimes.com">NYTimes.com</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.medium.com">Medium.com</a></strong>, etc. Each page is built from scratch, with ideas copied from people far smarter than me from around the web. Wherever I could, I tried to use semantic HTML, which means organizing content in logical containers like <code>article</code> and <code>figure</code>. It also makes for cleaner code.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Experimenting with different layouts for content, using the tools of the web to create unique experiences, is so much fun. There are a number of simple techniques that allow typography to pop on the web. That's the art of typefaces, point sizes, letter-spacing (tracking), etc. The first letter of the paragraph above is one example. Another is limiting text to 80 - 100 characters per line. Otherwise, everything you read starts to  look like Wikipedia and your eyes will glaze over.
		</p>
		<h2>Images</h2>
		<img class="mid-size" src="https://mave.me/img/projects/full_placeholder.png" data-action="zoom">
		<figcaption>I'm a <code>figcaption</code> for the above image.</figcaption>
		<p>
		  This image spans 3 columns of the 7 columns total in the layout. That gives the image more breathing room and breaks up the page visually. 
		</p>
		<h2>Fonts</h2>
		<p>When designing a website you should consider fonts for three types of text: the <strong>content</strong>, the <strong>UI</strong>, and <strong>your brand</strong>. Specifically I found that the best free alternatives <i>(Google Fonts)</i> to the handcrafted fonts that Medium uses are <span class="highlighted">Lora</span>, <span class="highlighted">Montserrat</span>, and <span class="highlighted">Playfair Display SC</span>. I discovered with delight that the last one mimics almost perfectly the effect created especially for a <code>blockquote</code> element.
		    <aside>I'm an example of an <code>aside</code> element. Appears on the right on large screens and as a row on smaller screens.</aside>
		</p>
		<h2>Content font</h2>
		<p>
		   The content font should be a serif one, to gently bring your eyes from one letter to the other with
		  the lowest amount of effort.<br/><code>line-height</code> and <code>letter-spacing</code> are vital here. Play with those parameters to make the most out of your font of choice. However at <strong>Medium</strong> you'll find almost an empty line of space in the middle of two lines of text (<code>line-height: 1.58;</code>).
		  While the space between the charachters is kept a little bit on the negative side (<code>letter-spacing: -0.03;</code>) to make words feel more compact.
		</p>

		<h2>Brand font</h2>
		<p>
		   The purpose of this font is to enforce the presence of our brand during the navigation experience.
		  We can use it for titles and, here and there, for some minutiae. The brand font we are using on this page is <i>Playfair Display</i>. Notice the <code>border-left</code> on the following blockquote- this is done using CSS Grid.
		</p>
		<blockquote>There is no sincerer love than the love of food.</blockquote>
		<h2>UI font</h2>
		<p>
		   The font used for all the UI elements is preferably a sans-serif one. It should create contrast with the content font.
		  Its color could be a little bit lighter than the one used for the main content. <br/>It needs to be readable given the background-color of your page 
		  but not distracting from the main purpose of the page- <span class="highlighted">reading</span>!<br/>You can also use it for <code>h2</code> - the titles for your paragraphs. Here the color should be the same as the one used for the main title.
		</p>
		<p>Maintaining <a href="#footnotes" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">footnotes</a> manually can be a pain. By using <a href="#css" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="css-ref">CSS</a> <a href="#css-counters" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="css-counters-ref">counters</a> to add the numbered references in the text and an ordered list to display the actual footnotes in the footer, it becomes extremely easy.</p>
		<aside>One problem with these footnotes is that they change the URL</aside>
		<h2><span class="highlighted">The highlight</span></h2>
		<p>To highlight a word or phrase you can wrap them in a <code>span</code> element and <span class="highlighted">set the background to a color that evokes your brand color identity</span>. Here I am using a simple green.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://mave.me/img/projects/full_placeholder.png">
		</figure>
		<figcaption>A figure spans the entire page, as opposed to a medium image.</figcaption>
		<h2>The length</h2>
		<p class="lineLength">
		   The length of a line of text should never be longer than <code>740px</code>. So our eyes are not forced to run from left to right on the page. CSS Grid makes this really simple to accomplish- on this page we have a 7 column layout made up of 2 <code>fr units</code>, a tiny 10px gutter column (used for the 
		   blockquote border), and a central column with a <code>max-width</code> of 740px.</p>		   

		<p class="subtitle">The subtitle</p>
		<p>Here we find <code>rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.54)</code> to give the subtitle meaningful information without grabbing the attention that the title deserves. This subtitle is a <code>p</code> element, but it should probably be a h3 or h4 element instead. Coming up next we have a full bleed image:</p>
		<h2>The color</h2>
		<p>
		   The text color should be <code>rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84)</code> on a <code>rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)</code> background to ensure the best contrast possible.</p>
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>As always, the strict first rule of design is that there are no strict rules.<br/>But, if you are looking for a good template... </p>
