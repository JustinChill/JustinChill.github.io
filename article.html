		<h2 class="subtitle">Typography and styling for JustinChill.com</h2>

	</header>

		<p>
		  This page serves as a template for blog posts on my website, JustinChill.com. It's layout and design is inspired by one of the best examples of online typography I could think of: <strong>Medium.com</strong>. This page uses semantic HTML, meaning that the content is organized in logical containers, like <code>article</code> and <code>figure</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
		  There are a number of simple techniques that allow typography to pop on the web. You've probably noticed that fancy first letter of the paragraph- that's one example! 
		</p>
		<p>Now let's demonstrate how <code>images</code> and more can be styled.</p>
		<h2>Medium sized images</h2>
		<img class="mid-size" src="https://mave.me/img/projects/full_placeholder.png" data-action="zoom">
		<figcaption>This is the caption for the above image. It's an HTML element called a <code>figcaption</code>.</figcaption>
		<p>
		  This image spans 3 columns of the 7 columns total in the layout. That gives the image more breathing room and breaks up the page visually. 
		</p>
		<h2>Fonts</h2>
		<p>When designing a website you should consider fonts for three types of text: the <strong>content</strong>, the <strong>UI</strong>, and the <strong>brand</strong>. Specifically I found that the best free alternatives <i>(Google Fonts)</i> to the handcrafted fonts that Medium uses are <span class="highlighted">Lora</span>, <span class="highlighted">Montserrat</span>, and <span class="highlighted">Playfair Display</span>. I discovered with delight that the last one mimics almost perfectly the effect created especially for a <code>blockquote</code> element.
		    <aside>This is an example of an <code>aside</code> element. It appears on the right on large screens and as a row on smaller screens.</aside>
		</p>
		<h2>Content font</h2>
		<p>
		   The content font should be a serif one, to gently bring your eyes from one letter to the other with
		  the lowest amount of effort.<br/><code>line-height</code> and <code>letter-spacing</code> are vital here. Play with those parameters to make the most out of your font of choice. However at <strong>Medium</strong> you'll find almost an empty line of space in the middle of two lines of text (<code>line-height: 1.58;</code>).
		  While the space between the charachters is kept a little bit on the negative side (<code>letter-spacing: -0.03;</code>) to make words feel more compact.
		</p>
		<h2>Brand font</h2>
		<p>
		   The purpose of this font is to enforce the presence of our brand during the navigation experience.
		  We can use it for titles and, here and there, for some minutiae. The brand font we are using on this page is <i>Playfair Display</i>. Notice the <code>border-left</code> on the following blockquote- this is done using CSS Grid.
		</p>
		<blockquote>Blockquotes are an example of a brand font.</blockquote>
		<h2>UI font</h2>
		<p>
		   The font used for all the UI elements is preferably a sans-serif one. It should create contrast with the content font.
		  Its color could be a little bit lighter than the one used for the main content. <br/>It needs to be readable given the background-color of your page 
		  but not distracting from the main purpose of the page- <span class="highlighted">reading</span>!<br/>You can also use it for <code>h2</code> - the titles for your paragraphs. Here the color should be the same as the one used for the main title.
		</p>
		<p>Maintaining <a href="#footnotes" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">footnotes</a> manually can be a pain. By using <a href="#css" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="css-ref">CSS</a> <a href="#css-counters" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="css-counters-ref">counters</a> to add the numbered references in the text and an ordered list to display the actual footnotes in the footer, it becomes extremely easy.</p>
		<aside>One problem with these footnotes is that they change the URL</aside>
		<h2><span class="highlighted">The highlight</span></h2>
		<p>To highlight a word or phrase you can wrap them in a <code>span</code> element and <span class="highlighted">set the background to a color that evokes your brand color identity</span>. Here I am using a simple green.</p>
		<h1>Every H1 Title</h1>
		<p class="subtitle">Needs a subtitle</p>
		<p>Here we find <code>rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.54)</code> to give the subtitle meaningful information without grabbing the attention that the title deserves. This subtitle is a <code>p</code> element, but it should probably be a h3 or h4 element instead. Coming up next we have a full bleed image:</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://mave.me/img/projects/full_placeholder.png">
		</figure>
		<figcaption>This is a caption for the above figure. Note that a figure spans the entire page, while a medium image will span only part way (on desktop).</figcaption>
		<h2>The length</h2>
		<p class="lineLength">
		   The length of a line of text should never be longer than <code>740px</code>. So our eyes are not forced to run from left to right on the page. CSS Grid makes this really simple to accomplish- on this page we have a 7 column layout made up of 2 <code>fr units</code>, a tiny 10px gutter column (used for the 
		   blockquote border), and a central column with a <code>max-width</code> of 740px.</p>		   
		<h2>The color</h2>
		<p>
		   The text color should be <code>rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84)</code> on a <code>rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)</code> background to ensure the best contrast possible.</p>
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>As always, the strict first rule of design is that there are no strict rules.<br/>But, if you are looking for a good template... </p>
