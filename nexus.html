<p>Author Yuval Noah Harari brilliantly captures the modern age in Nexus, his latest book. Drawing on a fascinating range of historical examples from the Stone Age, through the Bible, to early modern witch-hunts, Stalinism, Nazism and the resurgence of populism today, Harari gives us a powerful framework with which to consider the complex relationship between information and truth, bureaucracy and mythology, wisdom and power. He examines the existential crises humanity faces, like global warming and fears of non-human intelligence, as big information-related challenges.</p>
<p>"Nexus" is a story in two parts. The first half is an overview of information presented with clarity and confidence by Yuval. This is familiar territory for the historian and best selling author. The second half of the book recommends policies and offers parables for understanding the unprecendented upheaval AI ("alien intelligence", Yuval convincingly argues) will unleash. </p>
<p>The "naive view" of information assumes that more information is always better and likely to lead to the truth. Yuval excoriates this position, reminding us the internet did not end totalitarianism, and racism cannot be fact-checked away. But he also warns against a “populist view” that objective truth does not exist and that information should be wielded as a weapon.</p>
<h3>How does the story of Cher Ami relate to information?</h3>

      <figcaption>Cher Ami the carrier pigeon</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>Cher Ami, a carrier pigeon, delivered a crucial message that saved hundreds of soldiers despite not understanding the contents of the message. This shows how information can take various forms (like a pigeon carrying a note) and can have real-world consequences independent of the sender's or recipient's understanding of its significance. From letters sent by carrier pigeon it's easy to make the jump to data shared in a computer network.</p></section>
<h3>How can music be viewed as a form of information?</h3>
<p>Music connects people and synchronizes their emotions and movements, creating collective experiences without needing to represent reality. For instance, marching soldiers, conga line dancers, and sports fans all find unity and connection through shared musical experiences. The are new <strong>intersubjective</strong> realities, meaning between two subjects (or nodes, in an information network).</p>
<h3>What role do intersubjective realities play in society?</h3>
<p>Intersubjective realities like nations, laws, and currencies exist through collective belief and shared narratives. This allows for large-scale organization among humans. Each improvement in information technology has connected a greater number of people (nodes) together than the previous generation.</p>
<h3>What is the Bible, in the context of an information network?</h3>
<p>Yuval points out that all modern religions have tried to codify the words of a higher power in holy text. The Bible was curated by a councel of the church elite and widely distributed by the Roman Catholic church (while simultaneously suppressing alternative religious scripture). While the Bible may contain inaccuracies about human history and nature, its true power lies in its ability to connect billions of people, creating religious and social networks that endure over time, highlighting the primary role of information as a connector.

<blockquote class="mid-size"><p>We’re living through the most profound information revolution in human history, but we can’t understand it unless we understand what has come before. History, after all, isn’t the study of the past–it is the study of change. It teaches us what remains the same, what changes, and how things change. History is not deterministic, however, and NEXUS doesn’t argue that understanding the past enables us to predict the future. My goal is to show that by making informed choices, we can still prevent the worst outcomes. Because if we can’t change the future, then why waste time discussing it?</p><cite class="right">Yuval Noah Harari</cite></blockquote>
<h3>What are stories and lists?</h3>
<p>Stories inspire and create a sense of identity and purpose, while lists provide the essential data and organization needed for bureaucratic functions, tax collection, and maintaining complex societal structures. Stories create the sense of national pride, while lists help organize information into bins or drawers. Human bureaucracies struggle to retrieve information from vast archives of written documents, requiring organized systems to manage increasing amounts of data. So far in history (e.g. Stalinish) it has been impossible to process this information. Advancements in information technology and the way AI will progress thanks to its self learning mechanisms means that processing information like this is not an issue. Indeed, it will be precisely the ideal sort of data vacuuming system for an AI to flourish.
</p>
<h3>How do self-correcting mechanisms operate in different institutions?</h3>
<p>Self-correcting mechanisms are essential for the longevity of institutions. In scientific institutions, this involves practices such as peer review and public dissemination of findings, where scholars actively seek to find and rectify mistakes. Conversely, religious institutions often struggle with this due to their own claims of infallibility, often causing them to obscure their errors instead of embracing correction.</p>
<p>Thus the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is able to update and amend itself to remove homosexuality as a diagnosis in just 22 years, but the Catholic church is unable to apologize for the abuses of its members.</p>
<h3>How do witch hunts illustrate the complexities of information networks?</h3>

      <figcaption>Malleus Maleficarum</figcaption>
    </figure>
  <p>Heinrich Kramer's <em>Malleus Maleficarum</em> (Hammer of Witches), published in 1487, is a manual for hunting and persecuting witches. It led to hysteria and panic across Europe as people feared witches in their communities and families. The power of the printed word allowed the sensationalist stories and lurid details to spread far and wide.</p>
<p>The witch hunts demonstrate that the spread of sensational and false information can lead to mass hysteria and tragic outcomes. They highlight the power of narrative and the dangers of unchecked information, showing how belief systems can be influenced by social dynamics rather than objective truths.</p>

<h3>How does the flow of information differ between democracies and dictatorships?</h3>
<p>In democracies, information flows in a decentralized manner where multiple independent channels allow for diverse communication and decision-making. This creates an ongoing conversation among various nodes such as citizens, media, and institutions. In contrast, dictatorships feature a centralized network where information flows to a single authority, limiting transparency and accountability. This central hub dictates actions, stifling dissent and debate.</p>
<p>Technology significantly impacts the structure and function of political systems. It can enhance democracy by facilitating communication and information between citizens, fostering participation and engagement. Conversely, technology can empower totalitarian regimes by enabling centralized control and surveillance, allowing these systems to monitor and repress dissent effectively.</p>
<p>Modern information technology can amplify extreme voices, spread misinformation, and polarize public opinion, posing risks to democratic discourse. The ease of dissemination can lead to manipulation of information and erosion of trust in democratic institutions, challenging how societies engage in civil dialogue.</p>
<h3>How has the evolution of computers changed the power dynamics in society?</h3>
<p>The rise of computers has transferred power from humans to machines, as computers are capable of making autonomous decisions and generating new ideas. Unlike previous tools such as printing presses and radios, computers function as <em>active agents</em> that can influence social and cultural dynamics, leading to unprecedented changes in how society operates.</p>
<p>If computers can compose and interpret narratives, they may manipulate human beliefs and opinions, impacting political and social structures. This could lead to a future where human culture and society are heavily influenced—or even controlled—by nonhuman intelligences crafting convincing narratives and fostering intimate relationships with users.</p>
<h3>How has surveillance evolved from ancient times to today?</h3>
<p>Surveillance has transformed from manual human monitoring by families and communities in ancient times to complex bureaucratic systems aimed at controlling populations through data collection and analysis. Initially, humans were watched by peers and authority figures like rulers and priests; today, technology allows for almost universal surveillance, where computers and AI can continuously track our activities, behaviors, and even thoughts in real-time.</p>
<h3>What role does fear play in totalitarian surveillance regimes?</h3>
<p>Fear is a crucial weapon in totalitarian regimes, as it creates a populace that is self-regulating. Even if a regime cannot monitor every action constantly, the mere possibility of surveillance fosters fear among citizens, leading them to self-censor and adhere to oppressive norms out of dread of being observed. Digital agents, however, have no fear and won't be intimidated.</p>
<h3>How can systems of accountability be established for intelligent algorithms?</h3>
<p>Depressingly this feels like the weakest part of the book too me. Systems of accountability for intelligent algorithms could be established by creating regulatory frameworks that include ethics panels, regular technology audits, and mechanisms for public input and scrutiny. This multifaceted approach would help ensure that these systems operate in alignment with human values.</p>
<p>Harari outlines several principles for the survival of democracy including benevolence (technology should serve citizen's interests), decentralization (information should not be controlled by a single entity), mutuality (both citizens and governments should be monitored), and the importance of allowing for change and rest. These principles aim to maintain democratic integrity and accountability in an increasingly automated world.
