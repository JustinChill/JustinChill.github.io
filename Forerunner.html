      <p>Long before the sun rose the waters came rushing. Heavy rain swelled the rivers in Texas’s hill country until they burst their banks, drowning people, cars and trailers before dawn on July 4<sup>th</sup>. 135 people died, including at least 71 adults and 37 children. The number of people still missing in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/us/politics/texas-floods-hearing.html">Kerr County</a> has remained at two after falling from nearly one hundred. More than two dozen of the dead are children and counsellors from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp for girls whose cabins dotted the bank of the Guadalupe River. What can be done to mitigate such tragedy?</p>
      <p>Floods occur naturally and can happen almost anywhere. They may not even happen near a body of water, although river and coastal flooding are two of the most common types. Heavy rains, poor drainage, and even nearby construction projects can increase the risk and severity of flood damage.<a href="#FEMA" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="FEMA-ref"></a></p>
      <p>Chances of experiencing flooding are higher than the average wildfire risk. Floods cause $40 billion dollars (2015 USD) in damages annually and affected 2.5 billion people between 1994 and 2014<a href="#nature" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="nature-ref"></a>. Most homeowners insurance excludes flood damage, making flood insurance essential. <a href="https://agents.floodsmart.gov/sites/default/files/fema_nfip-summary-coverage-brochure-12-2023.pdf#page=2" target="_blank">Official definition of a flood</a>.</p>
      <p>A key factor in understanding and mitigating impacts from flooding is knowing where flooding occurs on a regular basis. Accurate flood extent mapping provides essential data for various purposes. It helps urban planners design resilient infrastructure, aids in developing early warning systems for communities, and supports insurance companies and policymakers in assessing risks and allocating resources.</p>
      <p>By understanding past flooding events, communities can better prepare for future occurrences, leading to safer and more resilient living environments. While mapping flood extent is important, doing this manually on site is often challenging, especially in developing countries where resources are scarce. In addition, ground-based assessments are often useful for small areas only.</p>
      <p>That's where satellites can help. Satellite data offers a powerful tool for mapping flood extent around the globe. Two primary types of sensors are commonly used for this observation: optical/infrared and Synthetic Aperture Radar (<abbr title="Synthetic Aperture Radar">SAR</abbr>).</p>
      <p>Optical/infrared sensors passively capture reflected light, yielding <a href="https://explorer1.jpl.nasa.gov/galleries/earth-from-space/">familiar photographic images</a> with benefits like wide availability and frequent observations at various resolutions. However, their effectiveness is limited by cloud cover and a dependence on daylight.</p>
      <aside class="bottom">While <abbr title="Synthetic Aperture Radar">SAR</abbr> is often described as all-weather, its signal may be affected during extremely heavy rainfall.</aside>
      <p>In contrast, <abbr title="Synthetic Aperture Radar">SAR</abbr> actively emits microwave signals and records their reflections, offering advantages such as being able to penetrate through cloud cover and operate in both day and night conditions.</p>
      <p><abbr title="Synthetic Aperture Radar">SAR</abbr> imagery offers a significant advantage for flood detection because <abbr title="Synthetic Aperture Radar">SAR</abbr> microwave signals penetrate cloud cover and can be used in both day and night conditions.</p>
      <h3>Flood maps</h3>
      <p>Flood maps help mortgage lenders determine insurance requirements and help communities develop strategies for reducing their risk. The mapping process helps a community understand their flood risk and make more informed decisions about how to reduce or manage that risk.</p>
      <p>Flood maps are one tool that communities use to know which areas have the highest risk of flooding. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, <small>FEMA</small>, maintains and updates data through flood maps and risk assessments.</p>
      <div class="fema-callout rounded"><img src="https://www.fema.gov/profiles/femad8_gov/themes/fema_uswds/images/arrow.svg" alt="alert - info">
        <p><strong>Flood maps show how likely it is for an area to flood.</strong> <br />Any area with a 1% or higher chance of experiencing a flood each year is considered to have a high risk. Those areas have at least a one-in-four chance of flooding during a 30-year mortgage.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Through Risk Mapping, Assessment and Planning (Risk <abbr title="Mapping, Assessment and Planning">MAP</abbr>)&nbsp;, <small>FEMA</small> is updating the nation’s coastal&nbsp;Flood Insurance Studies (FIS)&nbsp;and&nbsp;Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs, or flood maps), where appropriate, and publishing new flood maps of densely populated areas that were not previously mapped. With these new and updated maps, communities can make floodplain management decisions based on the best available scientific information.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance" rel="noreferrer">National Flood Insurance Program</a> (NFIP) is a federal program created in 1968 to provide flood insurance to people who live in areas with the greatest risk of flooding, called <em>Special Flood Hazard Areas</em>. The program provides an alternative to disaster assistance and reduces the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods. The program provides flood insurance, while at the same time encouraging the sensible management and use of floodplains to reduce flood damage.</p>
      <p>If a community adopts and enforces a floodplain management ordinance to reduce future flood risks to new construction in these Special Flood Hazard Areas, the federal government will make flood insurance available to the community.</p>
      <h2>Coastal flooding</h2>
      <p>Coastal flooding is when water inundates or covers normally dry coastal land as a result of high or rising tides or storm surges. </p>
      <span class="header-tag mid-size"><img src="imgs/tag.svg" alt="Chart header tag"></span>
      <h3 class="mid-size">Coast to coast</h3>
      <figure id="map" aria-label="A choropleth map of the United States visualizing coasting flood risk by county." class="mid-size">
        <figcaption class="right">Data: <a href="https://eelp.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NRI_Future_Risk_Technical_Document.pdf">FEMA</a></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In <small>FEMA</small>'s <a href="https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/coastal-flooding">National Risk Index</a>, a <code>Coastal Flooding Risk Index</code> score and rating represent a community's relative risk for coastal flooding as compared to the rest of the United States. A <code>Coastal Flooding Expected Annual Loss</code> score and rating represent a community's relative level of expected building and population loss each year due to coastal flooding when compared to the rest of the United States.</p>
      <p>The map above visualizes that relative risk score by community across the US. Shown as an interactive map, relative geographic features and risk patterns emerge. Understanding your relative flood risk can be a matter of life and death, so accurate data is crucial.</p>
      <p>On December 12, 2024, <small>FEMA</small> launched a prototype of the <a href="https://eelp.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NRI_Future_Risk_Technical_Document.pdf">Future Risk Index</a> showing projected economic losses due to climate change at the county level, based on different greenhouse gas emission scenarios and environmental hazards (coastal flooding, extreme heat, wildfire, hurricanes, and drought). The Index was the first free, publicly available tool showing how much climate change is likely to cost communities in the United States. The Future Risk Index was designed as a supplement to <a href="https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/"><small>FEMA</small>’s National Risk Index</a>, which includes criteria on social vulnerability and community resilience.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the population of people living in flood-prone areas is increasing due to migration and population growth. All of these impacts are expected to become even more severe with climate change.</p>

      <p>Satellites have drastically changed how we forecast hurricanes. NASA satellites closely measure temperatures from the atmosphere and sea’s surface, which in addition to improved sensors, allow scientists to predict forecasts with better accuracy in advance.</p>
      <p>"NASA's role is really about developing new technology, taking new measurements from space of the earth from a variety of perspectives using a constellation of satellites," said Dr. Scott Braun, a NASA scientist, in a news <a href="https://www.fox5ny.com/news/how-nasa-tracks-and-studies-hurricanes">interview</a>.</p>

      <p>Earth's warming climate is also amplifying fire activity, particularly in the northern hemisphere and temperate forests. When fires ignite the landscape, satellites and instruments can detect and track them. This information helps communities and land managers around the world <a href="https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/wildfires">prepare for and respond</a> to fires, and also provides <a href="https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/our-impact/story/nasa-gwis-research-projects-answering-call-wildfire">a rich data source</a> to help scientists better understand this growing risk.</p>
      <q>Fire season is getting longer, and emissions larger.</q>
      <p class="hds-listicle-list-description">In 2021, a destructive <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/149286/colorado-faces-winter-urban-firestorm">wintertime wildfire in Colorado</a> became part of a growing trend of wildfire activity <a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2019/06/27/wildfires-all-seasons">extending well beyond the summer</a>. Looking back at 35 years of weather data, scientists for the U.S. Forest Service found that fire seasons are starting earlier in the spring and extending later into autumn. Parts of the Western United States, Mexico, Brazil, and East Africa now have fire seasons that are more than a month longer than they were 35 years ago.</p>
      <p>Wildfires also can be a major source of carbon dioxide emissions. Researchers found that carbon emissions from forest fires <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl5889">increased by 60%</a> globally between 2001 and 2023. Fire emissions from boreal forests in Eurasia and North America <mark>nearly tripled</mark> during that same time period driven by a warmer, drier climate. In 2023, Canada’s warmest and driest conditions since 1980 stoked <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151985/tracking-canadas-extreme-2023-fire-season">extreme fires</a> that lasted for five months. NASA researchers found that these fires released about <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/earth/new-nasa-study-tallies-carbon-emissions-from-massive-canadian-fires/">640 million metric tons</a> of carbon.<a href="#NASA" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="NASA-ref"></a></p>

      <h3>After the emergency: damage assessment </h3>
      <p>If you manually surveyed areas devastated by natural disasters, it would take days. That’s why analysts often use satellite images to assess the extent and magnitude of damage and <strong>create damage maps</strong>. With access to a satellite imagery archive, it’s easy to compare images of the area from before and after the event, which helps emergency management organizations quickly understand the effect of the emergency and its impact on the environment.</p>
      <img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63f25e6e506ad0ff620cb9c5/63f25e6e506ad03c970cbb69_austin.gif" alt="Forerunner mapping platform in use." loading="lazy" class="rounded" />
      <h2>Forerunner</h2>
      <p>Founded in 2019, <a href="https://www.withforerunner.com/about">Forerunner</a> builds software to address critical gaps in floodplain management and improve community resilience. The company works with more than 130 communities dealing with natural emergencies and other potential disasters<a href="#govtech" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="govtech-ref"></a>.</p>
      <p>Forerunner also assists with compliance requirements and maximizing Community Rating System (CRS) credits. The <abbr title="Community Rating System">CRS</abbr> program incentivizes communities to exceed the minimum requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program by offering discounts on flood insurance premiums to residents.</p>
      <p>“Policies can easily be in the thousands of dollars and now when you apply the 15% <abbr title="Community Rating System">CRS</abbr> discount, it’s a substantial savings for the residents.” This is what Ed Striedl, Construction Official, Floodplain Manager and Zoning Official in Keansburg, New Jersey, thinks of when he considers the challenges and rewards of the <abbr title="Community Rating System">CRS</abbr> program. “One of my best Christmas presents was when I was informed by our ISO specialist that no corrections needed to be made to any of the ECs [elevation certificates] we submitted for our <abbr title="Community Rating System">CRS</abbr> recertification".<a href="#Keansburg" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="Keansburg-ref"></a></p>
      <p>Indeed, the Forerunner Elevation Certificate (EC) Error Detection feature automatically highlights potential issues with uploaded Elevation Certificates. The software is able to identify <a href="https://forerunner.helpscoutdocs.com/article/35-issues-guide">clerical errors</a>, FEMA FIRM information mistakes, discrepancies in elevation measurements, and <a href="https://forerunner-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/EC+Error+Detection.pdf">more</a>.</p>
      <h3>Community outreach</h3>
      <p>Forerunner offers public-facing websites where residents can access property-level flood risk information. The <a href="https://app.withforerunner.com/login">Municipal dashboard</a> simplifies workflows and saves time for resource-constrained communities, while the <a href="https://monmouthbeachnj.withforerunner.com/explore">Resident Flood Information Center</a> provides a turn-key website for residents.</p>
      <h3>SWOT analysis</h3>
      <p><strong>Strengths</strong>: As a robust geospatial platform with custom workflows, Forerunner allows communities to easily digitize and automate their disaster recovery processes. Governments can manage environmental hazards, community feedback, grants, permits, citizen mailings, and custom objects in one integrated platform. Climate change is an equal opportunity hazard, affecting people everywhere.</p>
      <p><strong>Weakness</strong>: Dependent on data from FEMA, subject to <a href="https://eelp.law.harvard.edu/tracker/rollback-fema-removed-future-risk-index/">the whims</a> of the current administration. <em>The FIRM data that populates Forerunner's Property Info Panel and Map is pulled directly and regularly from FEMA's Map Service Center.</em></p>
      <p><strong>Opportunities</strong>: Leverage current expertise in mapping and community safety to include new geographies, additional environmental hazards and risk models. Low-cost <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/science-enabling-technology/technology-highlights/big-weather-data-from-tiny-cubesat/">satellites</a> can offer additional data streams with greater reliability.
