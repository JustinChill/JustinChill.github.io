          <p>Worry less about if they like you, and more about <u>if you even like them</u>.</p>
          <p>Rejection is not as personal as it feels. <u>Liking someone or being liked is more about compatibility than inherent worth</u>.</p>
          <p><u>Stop choosing what isn't choosing you</u>. If it's not mutual, why pursue it?</p>
          <p>Ask yourself: Would you be friends with this person if you weren't physically attracted to them? <u>Be honest</u>.</p>
          <p>Get clear on what you want to give in a relationship, <u>not just what you want to receive</u>. What unique value do you bring to a partnership?</p>
          <p>Know what you want from a potential partner. What are your non-negotiables? What are you flexible on? Then <u>communicate your needs, don't just think them</u>.</p>
        </div>      

        <div class="column">
          <p>Stop being shocked by repeated behavior. For example, if someone has continuously shown you they aren't a good texter, stop expecting them to be. <u>Notice patterns and believe them</u>.</p>
          <p>You don't need to be perfect to be loved. "Perfection" isn't relatable. You can't connect to it. We all have flaws and vulnerabilities, and being able to own them is one of the most attractive things we can do. <u>The right person will embrace the things you once felt you had to hide</u>.</p>
          <p><u>Your love life is one area of your life. Don't forget to nurture the rest</u>. Significant other aside, when you visualize coming home to a life you love, what does that look like? Get specific.</p>
